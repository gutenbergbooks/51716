<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>These pages were written in Belgium between the
4th August, 1914, and the 15th August, 1915.</p>

<p>I employed in this work only those books and
periodicals which entered the country, whether
secretly or openly, and which every one, therefore,
can procure.</p>

<p>But to drive conviction into the reader's mind I
have observed a rule of selection in using these
documents: I have used those exclusively which
are of German origin, or which are censored by
the Germans.</p>

<p>They are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(A)  German posters exposed in Belgium.</p>

<p>(B)  Books and newspapers coming from
Germany.</p>

<p>(C)  Newspapers published in Belgium under
the German censorship.</p>

<p>(D)  The <i xml:lang="nl">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant</i>,
the only foreign newspaper which
has been authorized in Belgium
since the beginning of the occupation.
As for the Belgian <i>Grey
Books</i>, the Reports of the Commission
of Inquiry, and books published
in Belgium, of these I used
only those which were known to
us in Belgium before the 15th
August, 1915.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>In short, since I crossed the frontier I have not
inserted a single idea into this book: it therefore
precisely reflects the state of mind of a Belgian
who has lived a year under the German domination.</p>

<p>I have forced myself to remain as far as possible
objective, in order to give my work the scientific
rigour which characterizes the Reports of the
Belgian Commission of Inquiry. I have simply
transferred, to a domain which is new to me, the
methods of my customary occupations.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Bismarck was given to quoting, with approval, a
saying which has often been attributed to him,
but which was, in reality, first made in his
presence by a hero of the American Civil War&mdash;General
Sheridan. It was, that the people of a
country occupied by a conquering army should be
left nothing&mdash;save eyes to weep with!</p>

<p>And we Belgians, truly, are weeping: weeping for
our native country, invaded, in contempt of the most
solemn conventions, by one of the signatories of
those treaties; weeping for our villages, which are
levelled to the ground, and our cities, which are
burned; our monuments, which are broken by
shell-fire, and our treasures of art and science,
which are for ever destroyed. We mourn to think of
those hundreds of thousands of our countrymen who
have wandered without shelter along the highways
of Europe; of Belgium, lately so proud of her prosperity,
but now taxed and crushed and exhausted
by war requisitions and contributions, and reduced
to holding out her hand for public charity.</p>

<p>Who could help but weep when, in Flanders, our
soldiers are defending the very last corner of our territory;
when, in our villages, men, old folks, women,
and children have been, and are yet, shot down
without pity in reprisal for imaginary crimes; when
thousands of civilians are imprisoned in Germany as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hostages; when the burgomaster of the capital, for
daring to defend the rights of his constituents, is
confined in a Silesian prison;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> when our rural clergy
is decimated, to such a point that divine service has
necessarily been suspended in entire cantons; when
a scholar like Van Gehuchten dies in exile, after
seeing his manuscripts and his drawings, the fruit
of ten years' labours, disappear in the flames of
Louvain?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our sobs are mingled with tears of gratitude for
the compassionate intervention of Holland, America,
Spain, the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland,
and Italy ... not forgetting our Allies. It is this
generosity that has prevented us from dying of
hunger and want; a million of our refugees have
found in Holland a fraternal succour which has never
for a moment been relaxed; the United States,
thanks to the influence and the incomparable
activity of their Minister in Brussels, Mr. Brand
Whitlock, supply us with our daily bread.</p>

<p>Belgium will never forget the exactions of those
who have reduced to famine one of the richest and
most fertile countries in the world, nor the unequalled
charity of the nations which have enabled
us to live to this day, and have saved us from death
by starvation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>We are weeping! But we do not surrender ourselves
to despair, for we have kept intact our faith
in the future, and the firm resolve to leave no stone
unturned that we may for ever be spared such
another trial. Above all, we refuse to bow our
heads beneath the yoke. In vain have the Germans
afflicted us with increasingly unjust and unjustifiable
and vexatious demands; they will never
daunt us. Let them proscribe the Belgian flag as
a seditious emblem; we have no need to unfurl
it to remain faithful to it; they are welcome to
forbid the <i xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> on the day of the King's patron
saint; since the King and the Queen are valiantly
sharing, on the Yser, in the efforts and the sufferings
of our brothers and our sons, royalty has no
firmer supporters among us than the leaders of
Socialism. No, we assuredly are not ready to
abandon ourselves to despair. And nothing can
sustain us more than the international sympathies
by which we feel ourselves surrounded in this our
unmerited misfortune.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The time has not yet come to judge the events
which have delivered Europe to fire and blood. Yet
we hold that it is the duty of all those who believe
themselves in a position usefully to intervene to
make themselves heard. For Germany possesses
so perfect an organization for the diffusion of her
propaganda in foreign countries, that the public
opinion of neutral States, hearing but one side of
the question, would finally come to believe our
enemies.</p>

<p>It would be useless and ineffectual to accumulate,
as did the ninety-three German "intellectuals,"
among others, a number of denials and affirmations,
without supporting them by a single definite
fact. We do not wish to put forward anything
which we cannot immediately support by easily
verified proofs. This rule which we have compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ourselves to observe, has forced us narrowly to
limit our field of investigation. We shall speak
only of actions and intellectual manifestations which
are immediately connected with the present war;
and as the field would be too vast even when so
circumscribed, we shall say nothing of military
operations properly so-called, nor of all that has
happened beyond the Belgian frontiers. We do
not propose to write a history. We leave to those
more competent the task of extricating the truth as
to present events; we shall content ourselves with
taking indisputable documents, which are nearly
always cuttings from German books, or German
newspapers, or German posters, and with analysing
their mental significance; and, further, with showing
how the Belgians react against the actions recorded.</p>

<p>In the following pages we shall first of all
examine the <i>violation of Belgian neutrality by
Germany</i>, then the <i>infractions of the Hague
Convention of 18th October, 1907</i>. We shall be
careful to invoke only <i>precise and unquestionable
facts</i>; but for that matter the number of
German infractions of the law of nations in
Belgium is so enormous that we have been able
provisionally to exclude all those which are not
established in the most positive manner. At the
same time we shall endeavour to derive from these
facts a few indications as to our enemies' manner of
thinking. This last will be studied in further detail
in a third chapter: <i>German Mentality Self-depicted</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Intellectual Life in Belgium.</span></h3>

<p>A few words as to the documents utilized.</p>

<p>As the Germans occupied our country they took
pains to isolate us from the rest of the world. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
immediately suppressed all our journals, as these
naturally refused to submit to their censorship. At
the same time the Germans forced certain journals
to reappear; notably <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, at Namur,
and <i xml:lang="fr">Le Bien Public</i>, at Gand. The first of these
journals took care frankly to inform its readers that
the military authorities were forcing it to continue
publication.</p>

<p>As for foreign newspapers, their introduction was
forbidden under heavy penalties.</p>

foreign newspapers are intentionally publishing false news.</p>

<p>It is brought to the knowledge of the public that it is therefore
strictly forbidden to any one whomsoever to introduce into

<p><i>The German Censorship.</i></p>

<p>After the 20th August the eastern half of Belgium
was thus deprived of all intellectual communication
with the outside world. For a fortnight we were left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
absolutely without news. Then, from the 5th September,
the German Government permitted the
publication of journals which were carefully expurgated,
and falsified by a rigorous censorship:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> <i xml:lang="fr">Le
Quotidien</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">Le Bruxellois</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">L'Écho de Bruxelles</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">Les
Dernières Nouvelles</i>; and later <i xml:lang="fr">Le Belge</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique</i>,
<i xml:lang="fr">La Patrie</i>, etc., in Brussels, <i xml:lang="fr">L'Avenir</i> in Antwerp,
and many more. Although submitted to the censorship,
the appearance of these newspapers was only
provisional and uncertain. <i xml:lang="fr">Le Bien Public</i> reminds
its readers of the fact in its issue for the 13th December,
1914. All these journals were on occasion
suspended; for example, <i xml:lang="fr">Le Quotidien</i>, from the 9th
to the 11th December, 1914, without any reason
being given; <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, from the 2nd to
the 7th September, 1914, for having printed an
acrostic regarded as insulting; and <i xml:lang="fr">Le Bien Public</i>,
during the whole of May, 1915.</p>

<p>The illustrated journals were as much subject to
the censorship as the ordinary newspapers. Numbers
1 to 3 of <i xml:lang="fr">1914 Illustré</i>, published before the arrival of
the Germans, could no longer be exposed for sale:
No. 1 containing portraits of King Albert, Nicholas
II, M. Poincaré, and King George V; No. 2 the
portrait of General Leman, and No. 3 that of M.
Max. From November onwards the issues were
severely edited, so that they contained, for example,
scarcely any more photographs of towns burned by
the German army. The other illustrated papers&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr">Actualité
Illustré</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">Le Temps Présent</i>, etc., also had
none but anodyne photographs, such as portraits of
the new masters, military and civil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>In some degree to replace the newspapers, the
printers conceived the idea of publishing little booklets
relating to the war, but giving no direct news of
the military operations. These publications were
naturally subjected to the censorship, and many of
those which were published before the decree of the
13th October, 1914, were prohibited; it was thus
with the very interesting brochure, <i xml:lang="fr">M. Adolphe
Max, bourgmestre de Bruxelles, son administration
du 20th août au 26th septembre, 1914</i>, and the
Nos. 1 to 10 of the booklets issued by Mr.
Brian Hill. Illustrated postcards also were censored;
the series in course of publication, representing
the ruins of Louvain, Dinant, Charleroi,
Liége, etc., had to be interrupted. Music even had
to receive the official approbation (<i>see</i> the placard
of 27th March, 1915, p. <a href="#Page_274">274</a>).</p>

<p>In short, it will be seen that our public life already
very closely approached the German ideal: <i xml:lang="de">Alles ist
verboten</i>. To think that Belgium, so justly proud of
her constitutional liberties, is now crushed, breathless,
under the heavy Prussian jack-boot!</p>


<p><i>Authorized German Newspapers.</i></p>

<p>As a compensation for those which the German
Administration felt obliged to suppress, it allowed
us, about the 10th September, to receive some German
newspapers&mdash;the <i xml:lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</i>, <i xml:lang="de">Kölnische
Volkszeitung</i>, <i xml:lang="de">Düsseldorfer Tageblatt</i>, <i xml:lang="de">Düsseldorfer
General-Anzieger</i>, and also a few illustrated
papers, notably the <i xml:lang="de">Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung</i>,
<i xml:lang="de">Die Wochenschau</i>, <i xml:lang="de">Du Kriegs-Echo</i>. At a later date
other newspapers were tolerated: <i xml:lang="de">Vossissche Zeitung</i>,
<i xml:lang="de">Berliner Tageblatt</i>, <i xml:lang="de">Frankfurter Zeitung</i>,
<i xml:lang="de">Berliner Zeitung am Mittag</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami du Peuple</i>
(a special edition, for Belgium, in French and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
German, of <i xml:lang="de">Der Volksfreund</i>, of Aix-la-Chapelle), and
also some new illustrated papers, for example, <i xml:lang="de">Kriegsbilder</i>,
<i xml:lang="de">Zeit im Bild</i>, and above all the <i xml:lang="de">Illustrierte
Kriegs-Kurier</i>, published in German, Flemish, French,
and English,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> whose sixteen pages, all covered with
illustrations, cost only 15 centimes: evidently an
instrument of propaganda, subsidized by the Central
Administration. We shall have occasion later on
to insist on its veracity, if one may call it that. For
a long time none of these journals reached us
regularly.</p>

<p>We had also access to two journals published by
the Government itself: (1) the <i xml:lang="de">Deutsche Soldatenpost</i>
(<i xml:lang="de">Herausgegeben von der Zivil-Vorwaltung des
General-Gouverneurs in Belgiën</i>), originally reserved
for soldiers, but which was also sold to civilians&mdash;in
a very intermittent fashion, it is true&mdash;from September
1914 to the beginning of December 1914;
(2) <i xml:lang="fr">Le Réveil</i> (<i xml:lang="fr">Écho de la Presse, Journal officiel du
Bureau allemand à Düsseldorf pour la publication
de nouvelles authentiques à l'étranger</i>), the latter
being published simultaneously in French and German.
Forty-nine numbers were published. It felt
such an insurmountable disgust for untruth that
having announced in the introductory article of its
first number that Belgium was entirely in the hands
of the Germans, it spoke, in a neighbouring column,
of battles in Western Flanders between the Germans
and the Allies. Let us say at once that from the
point of view of sincerity and liberty of opinion all
the newspapers of the Trans-Rhenian world are of
equal worth: official or otherwise, they only publish
that which is allowed, or rather, inspired, by the
Government.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Authorized Dutch Newspapers.</i></p>

<p>One newspaper not subject to the Imperial censorship,
one only, has found grace with the authorities&mdash;the
<i xml:lang="nl">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant</i>. Its tendencies,
clearly favourable to Germany, enable it to penetrate
into Belgium; but not equally all over the
country. At Gand one may subscribe to it; but
its sale in single numbers is prohibited. In Antwerp
it was proscribed for several months from the 7th
December.</p>

<p>At Louvain and Brussels it may be sold in the
street, and also supplied to subscribers. But it must
not be supposed that the paper is anywhere regularly
distributed; the edition of the morning of the
10th November, 1914, was forwarded on the
27th November to a few subscribers who were particularly
persistent in their demands; it is true that
this number contains the article on the letters of
prisoners of war made by the Belgians (pp. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>-<a href="#Page_105">5</a>),
and that these letters annihilate not a few accusations
made by the Germans, while they throw a
singular light on their lies and acts of pillage. As
for the issues for the 6th, 7th, and 8th December,
1914, they were never distributed; an official announcement,
which appeared in <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> of
the 9th and 10th December states that these
numbers contain "inadmissible communications as
to the dislocation of troops." The issues of the 24th,
25th, and 26th December were also withheld.
Since January 1915 some ten numbers have been
prohibited each month.</p>

<p>From the <i xml:lang="nl">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant</i> we have
copied only the articles by contributors and correspondents
of the journal itself; it has seemed to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that to reproduce articles extracted from Belgian
newspapers was a proceeding which, while quite
usual among the Germans, is not entirely honest.</p>

<p>Another Dutch journal, the <i xml:lang="nl">Algemeen Handelsblad</i>
of Amsterdam, arrived in Brussels at the beginning
of November; but its licence was withdrawn at the
end of a week.</p>

<p>From February 1915 its sale was again authorized
in Belgium. At the same time the introduction
of a few other Dutch journals was permitted, their
pro-German character being indubitable: such were
<i xml:lang="nl">Het Vaterland</i>, <i xml:lang="nl">De Maasbode</i>, <i xml:lang="nl">De Nieuwe Courant</i>.</p>


<p><i>Newspapers introduced surreptitiously.</i></p>

<p>Let us say at once that despite all prohibitions
and all the sentences pronounced, prohibited newspapers
continue to trickle into the occupied portion
of the country. These newspapers were at first
those which were normally appearing in the towns
not yet subject to German authority. Thus <i xml:lang="fr">La
Métropole</i> and <i xml:lang="fr">Le Matin</i> of Antwerp, <i xml:lang="fr">Le Bien Public</i>
and <i xml:lang="fr">La Flandre Libérale</i> of Gand were very soon
carried as contraband and secretly sold in Brussels.
Again, in the regions not yet invaded, some of the
newspapers of the towns already occupied were
printed: thus <i xml:lang="fr">L'Indépendance Belge</i> of Brussels
appeared at Ostend until the arrival of the Germans
in that town.</p>

<p>The agents who sold these newspapers had also
foreign papers, especially French and English.
Later, when all Belgium, save a corner of Flanders,
was subjected to the Germans, a number of Belgian
papers were printed abroad: <i xml:lang="fr">La Métropole</i> and
<i xml:lang="fr">L'Indépendance Belge</i> in London and <i xml:lang="fr">Le XX<sup>e</sup> Siècle</i>
at Havre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>We also used to receive from time to time occasional
newspapers published by Belgian refugees
abroad. Of these we may cite: <i xml:lang="fr">L'Écho Belge</i>,
of Amsterdam, <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique</i>, of Rotterdam, <i xml:lang="fr">Les
Nouvelles</i>, and <i xml:lang="fr">Le Courrier de la Meuse</i>, of
Maastricht.</p>

<p>It will be understood that prohibited journals are
rare. On certain days, when the hunt for the
vendors is particularly fruitful, people will offer fifty
francs, or even two hundred, for a copy of the <i>Times</i>.
As it is chiefly across the Dutch frontier that the
smuggling of the English "dailies" is carried on,
the authorities have enacted measures which grow
more and more Draconian relating to the traffic
across this frontier. By the end of 1914 it had become
practically impossible to enter Belgium from
Holland by the ordinary route (<i>see</i> the <i xml:lang="de">Düsseldorfer
General-Anzeiger</i> of the 20th December, 1915). The
smugglers of journals are therefore obliged to insinuate
themselves in secret, and their trade is not
without danger; only in the suburbs of Putte (province
of Antwerp) the German sentinels killed two of
them in December 1914.</p>

<p>Since the spring of 1915 the frontier has been
guarded with barbed wire and wires traversed by high-tension
electric currents; the crossing has naturally
become more difficult. But "difficult" is not "impossible."</p>


<p><i>Secret Propagation of News.</i></p>

<p>So that a greater number of readers may profit by
the newspapers smuggled into the country, the important
passages, especially those relating to military
operations, are copied by means of the typewriter.
These extracts are searched after as much as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
originals, but none the less there are those who continue
to prepare and to distribute them in secret.
In Brussels alone there are fifteen of these secret
sheets, each of which has its public of subscribers;
many of them are gratuitous. From time to time our
oppressors scent out one of these typewriting establishments,
but some other devoted person immediately
continues the business.</p>

<p>In certain well-known establishments one could,
for a time, obtain the use of a newspaper for ten
minutes for one or two francs; but the secret was
finally betrayed, thanks to one or other of the innumerable
spies supported by the Government.</p>


<p><i>Secret Newspapers.</i></p>

<p>Finally, not a few persons, possessing a typewriting
machine or other means of reproducing
writing, copy and sell clandestinely, for the profit of
some charitable undertaking, articles from foreign
newspapers or reviews, which bear upon the current
political situation. Many documents have reached
us in this form.</p>

<p>Lastly, courageous Belgians have undertaken to
print, in the midst of the occupied territory, and in
spite of all the German prohibitions, newspapers
which reach a circulation of many thousands. The
two most important are <i xml:lang="fr">La Libre Belgique</i> and <i xml:lang="fr">La
Vérité</i>. In vain have our persecutors promised the
most enticing rewards to those who should denounce
the authors of these sheets; they continue imperturbably
to appear. Which proves, be it said in
passing, that the Germans lie most horribly when
they state that numbers of Belgians send them
anonymous information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<p><i>German Placards.</i></p>

<p>Our intellectual pasture also includes placards.
In the first place, the <i>Notices</i>, <i>Orders</i>, and <i>Proclamations</i>
of all kinds. Then the <i>News published by the
German Government</i>, placards usually written in
three languages, in the principal towns. In Brussels,
where they are known as <i xml:lang="de">Lustige Blätter</i>, they are
particularly numerous. At Louvain, Vilverde, and
Mons they are in manuscript, and usually written
in German only.</p>

<p>Two important sources of documentation are completely
closed: photography and correspondence by
post. The taking and reproduction of photographs
is strictly prohibited, above all in the towns ruined
by the Germans.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Notice.</span></div>

<p>Whosoever produces, without authorization, representations
of destruction caused by the war, or who displays, offers for
sale, sells, or otherwise distributes, by means of postcards,

burned or devastated by the war, will be punished by a fine not
exceeding 5,000 marks or a term of imprisonment not exceeding
one year. The seizure of formes and plates which shall have
served for the reproduction of these representations, as well as
their destruction, may also be ordered.</p>

<p><i>Regulations as to Correspondence.</i></p>

<p>The sending of letters by carrier is prohibited.
Until about the middle of December correspondence
was carried from town to town by the carriers who
undertake the goods traffic since the suspension of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the railways; one could still, therefore, easily enough
obtain news. But, as a souvenir of his joyous entry,
the Herr Baron von Bissing, who succeeded the Herr
Baron von der Goltz as Governor-General in Belgium,
suppressed this little supplementary vocation of the
carriers. Thus Senator Speyer was condemned to
pay a fine of 1,000 marks and to undergo 10 days'
imprisonment for the conveyance of letters. We
have no longer the resource of sending letters by
carrier pigeons, as these are closely scrutinized by
the Germans. Finally, two remaining methods of
transmitting letters were taken from us: the use of a
bow and arrow (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 1st January, 1915), and
enclosure in a loaf baked in Holland and sold in
Belgium. So it is needless to say that we have
neither telegraph nor telephone.</p>

<p>There is nothing to be done but to go in search of
information oneself, after finding out the hours
(highly variable) during which one is allowed to
"circulate" in the localities through which one
has to pass.</p>

<p>Since then it has become very difficult to obtain
precise information as to an event which has
occurred in another locality, for obviously one cannot
trust a missive of this kind to the German post,
which accepts only open letters, and passes them
through a <i xml:lang="fr">cabinet noir</i>; moreover, it does not
guarantee communication with all points.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">By Order of the German Authority.</span></div>

<p>After 8 p.m. (7 p.m. Belgian) there must be no lights in the
windows of the houses of the town of Herve.</p>

<p>The patrol has orders to fire into every window lit up, giving

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>It must also be explained what administrative
formalities one had to fulfil in order to obtain a
lodging. Thus, from January 1915 no one could
obtain a lodging in Gand, whether in an hotel, or a
boarding-house, or apartments, without first obtaining
the authorization of the <i xml:lang="de">Kommandantur</i>.</p>


<p><i>Railway Journeys.</i></p>

<p>Once furnished with a proper passport, one has
only to set out. By suitably arranging one's route,
one can often take advantage of the local tramways.
All other means of communication are extremely
precarious. The automobile is forbidden. Horses
have been requisitioned by the military authorities.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">General Arrangements.</span></div>

<p>A certain number of trains have during the last few days been
run over the Belgian railways by the German Government.</p>

<p>These are:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1. Brussels&mdash;Aix-la-Chapelle.<br />
2. Brussels&mdash;Lille.<br />
3. Brussels&mdash;Namur.<br />
4. Brussels&mdash;Charleroi.<br />
5. Louvain&mdash;Charleroi.<br />
6. Brussels&mdash;Antwerp.<br />
7. Brussels&mdash;Courtrai.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Owing to the defective state of the lines and the telegraphic
and signalling apparatus, these trains can as yet travel only at a
moderate pace, and the duration of the journey is not guaranteed.
For this reason it is prudent to provide oneself on departure with
the necessary provisions for the journey.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The time-table of the railways is often made up
in such a way that the Belgian cannot make use of
the trains. Thus the only train leaving Brussels for
Mons in November 1914 reached Mons at 9 p.m.
But after 9 p.m. it is forbidden to walk through the
streets of Mons. The only train leaving Mons for
Brussels leaves at 12.14 a.m., but one may not
"circulate" in the streets of Mons earlier than
4 a.m.</p>

<p>We see to what extremities the Belgian population
is reduced. Well, well!&mdash;despite all these difficulties,
we have procured documents of great
importance. We cannot, unfortunately, publish
them all at this juncture; for they would result in
the identification of those who conveyed them to
us, and expose them to reprisals; and we have
learned, to our cost, all that this term signifies
according to the ideas of our present rulers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This work, then, will necessarily be incomplete.
We publish it only because we think it useful to
demonstrate that in spite of all the annoyances
which they receive at the hands of the Germans,
the Belgians do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
Moreover, whatever may be the provisional
lacunæ (mostly intentional) of our documentation,
we cannot in any case be reproached with falsification.
This, whatever our enemies may think, is a
point of capital importance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
THE VIOLATION OF NEUTRALITY</h2>


<h3>A.&mdash;The Preliminaries.</h3>

<p>We were too confiding.</p>

<p>With the exception of the military and a few
statesmen, the Belgians were convinced that nations,
just as individuals, were bound by their engagements,
and that as long as we remained faithful
to our international obligations, the signatories of
the Treaty of London (19th April, 1839), which set
forth the conditions of the neutrality, or rather of
the neutralization, of Belgium (<i>Belg. All.</i>, p. 3),
would equally observe their obligations towards us.</p>

<p>However, in 1911, during the "Agadir crisis,"
our calm was a little shaken by a series of articles
in <i xml:lang="fr">Le Soir</i>. According to this journal, all the
German military writers held the invasion of Belgium
to be inevitable in the event of a war between France
and Germany.</p>


<p><i>The Belgians' Distrust of Germany lulled.</i></p>

<p>But our faith in international conventions&mdash;just
a trifle ingenuous, it may be&mdash;very soon regained
its comforting influence. Had not Wilhelm II, "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Emperor of Peace," assured the Belgian mission,
which was sent to greet him at Aix-la-Chapelle,
that Belgium had nothing to fear on the part of
Germany (see <i xml:lang="fr">L'Étoile Belge</i>, 19th October, 1911).
In September 1912 the Emperor made a fresh
reassuring statement. Being present at the Swiss
man&oelig;uvres, he congratulated M. Forster, President
of the Swiss Confederation, and told him how glad
he was to find that the Swiss Army would effectually
defend the integrity of her frontier against a French
attack. "What a pity," he added, "that the Belgian
Army is not as well prepared, and is incapable
of resisting French aggression." This evidently
meant that Belgium ran no risk from the side of
Prussia.</p>

<p>It was not only the Emperor who assured us of
his profound respect for international statutes. The
German Ministers made similar declarations in the
Reichstag (<i>Belg. All.</i>, p. 7).</p>

<p>In Belgium itself the Germans profited by every
occasion to celebrate their friendship for us and
their respect for treaties. In 1905, at the time of
the seventy-fifth anniversary of Belgian independence,
Herr Graf von Wallwitz stated at an official
reception: "And as for us Germans, the maintenance
of the treaty of warranty concluded at the
birth of modern Belgium is a sort of political axiom
which, to our thinking, no one could violate without
committing the gravest of faults" (<i>see</i> p. 185 of the
<i xml:lang="fr">Annales parlementaires belges, Senate, 1906</i>).</p>

<p>In 1913, at the time of the joyous entry of the
King and Queen into Liége, General von Emmich,
the same who was entrusted with the bombardment
of the city in August 1914, came to salute our
sovereigns in the name of the Emperor. He spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
incessantly of the German sympathies for the
Belgians and their country.</p>

<p>In August 1913 Herr Erzberger gave his word
of honour, as Catholic deputy to the Reichstag,
that there had never been any question of invading
Belgium, and that Belgium might always count on
the party of the Centre to cause international
engagements to be respected. This is the very
party that is now heaping up manifest falsehoods
in order to justify the aggression of Germany.</p>


<p><i>German Duplicity on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of
August, 1914.</i></p>

<p>Let us consider the days immediately preceding
the war. The German newspapers were announcing
that the troops occupying, at normal times, the
camps near the Belgian frontiers had been directed
upon Alsace and Lorraine; and these articles, reproduced
in Belgium, had succeeded in finally lulling
our suspicions.</p>

<p>In the currents of thought which were then
clashing in Belgium, it was confidence that carried
the day. Many of us who were present on the 1st
of August at a session of the Royal Academy of
Belgium, were speaking, before the session was
opened, of the serious events which were approaching,
the war already declared between Austria and
Serbia, and the conflict which appeared imminent
between Germany, France, Russia, and England.
Yet no one imagined that Belgium could be drawn
into the conflagration. That very morning, it was
related, France had officially renewed, through her
Minister in Brussels, the assurance that she would
faithfully abstain from violating the neutrality of
Belgium (1st <i>Grey Book</i>, No. 15); and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
no reason to doubt his words. A few days earlier
the German Minister in Brussels had affirmed that
his country had too much respect for international
conventions to permit herself to transgress them;
and we believed him too! Oh, simplicity! We
still believed him, on the following day, when he
repeated the same declaration (1st <i>Grey Book</i>,
No. 19; <i>Belg. All.</i>, p. 7). And on the evening of
that Sunday, the 2nd of August, he presented to
our Government the ultimatum of Germany (1st
<i>Grey Book</i>, No. 20).</p>


<p><i>The Ultimatum.</i></p>

<p>The telegram of the 2nd of August, by which
Herr von Jagow sent the ultimatum to the German
Minister in Brussels, declared: "Please forward this
Note to the Belgian Government, in a strictly official
communication, at eight o'clock this evening, and
demand therefrom a definite reply in the course of
twelve hours, that is, at eight o'clock to-morrow
morning" (<i xml:lang="de">Lüttich</i>, p. 4). Never, since Belgium's
birth, had a problem so breathless been placed before
her Government. And Germany left her twelve
hours to solve it: twelve hours of the night! She
was not willing that our Government should have
time to reflect at leisure; she hoped that in a
crisis of distraction Belgium, taken at a disadvantage
and forgetful of her dignity, would accept the
inacceptable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>However, the German Minister in Brussels continued
to offer us explanations which were as perfidious
as they were confused and obscure, and to
assure us up to the last of the friendly intentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of his Government. The Germany fashioned by
Bismarck has assuredly nothing about it to remind
us of the Germany of Goethe and Fichte. We
might have guessed as much, for that matter, when
we saw the Germans glorifying the man who <i>boasted</i>
of having falsified the famous Ems telegram in order
to make the war of 1870 inevitable, and who succeeded
in making his countrymen accept, as a
guiding principle, that "might comes before right."</p>


<p><i>The Speech of the Chancellor in the Reichstag.</i></p>

<p>However, we may suppose that some slight
scruples lingered in the recesses of the German
conscience, since on the very day when the Chancellor
of the Empire told the British Ambassador
in Berlin that an international convention is merely
"a scrap of paper,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and that neutrality is only a
word, he recognized, in his speech to the Reichstag,
that the invasion of Belgium constituted an injustice;
but he immediately excused this violation of
the law of nations by strategic necessities.</p>


<h3>B.&mdash;Justification of the Entry into Belgium.</h3>

<p>"Strategic necessities!" said the German Chancellor.
These necessities are expounded in the
ultimatum, and may be summed up thus: "Germany
knows that France is preparing to attack her
through Belgium."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>The first question which occurs to us is: Was
France really preparing to cross our territory, and
had she massed troops near our frontier? There
is assuredly no one outside Germany who would
admit this. Indeed, if important bodies of troops
had been massed in the north of France they could
effectually have opposed the advance of the Germans
through Belgium. Now in all the battles which the
French fought in our country their numbers were
much too small to resist the Germans. Let us
also remark that these attempts on the part
of the French were made on the 15th August
at Dinant, the 19th August at Perwez, and the
23rd August at Semois. How then can any one
believe that the French were massed close to our
frontier as early as 3rd August? Moreover, the
map published in the <i>N.R.C.</i> of the 16th December,
1914, confirms the untruthfulness of the
German allegations.</p>

<p>This "strategic reason" was again invoked by
the Chancellor of the Empire on the 4th August.
But owing to the irrefutable manner in which the
tardiness of the French movements disproved this
assertion the latter is no longer uttered, save in
an evasive manner. The German no longer says:
"France was ready to cross into Belgium," but
"France would not have failed to enter Belgium,
and we simply outstripped her." It is thus that
Count Bernstoff, the German ambassador to Washington,
expressed himself in the interview published
by <i xml:lang="fr">L'Indépendant</i> in September 1914,
while the same assertion is found in the manifesto
of the ninety-three German "Intellectuals" and
the letter addressed by Herr Max Bewer to
M. Maeterlinck (in the <i>D.G.A.</i> of October 1914
and the <i xml:lang="de">Soldatenpost</i> of the 14th October, 1914).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now ask if Germany had such suspicions
of France as amounted to a semi-certitude? In
other words, was she sincere in declaring that she
knew that France was on the point of invading
Belgium? We do not hesitate to assert that she
was lying: for if she had really believed that France
was ready to violate our neutrality it would have
been enormously to her advantage to wait until the
violation was committed. For Belgium has always
asserted that in case of war between France and
Germany she would resist by arms the first invader
and immediately join herself to the other Power.
Now Germany, however profound her political perversity
may be, had no reason to suspect the
sincerity of Belgium; she knew then&mdash;and this
time she <i>did</i> know&mdash;that by allowing the French
to enter our country she would assure herself of the
assistance of our army against her enemy. And
scanty as was her esteem for the Belgian soldiers&mdash;perhaps
she has since had occasion to change her
mind!&mdash;it was none the less obviously to her interest
to avoid having them as her adversaries.</p>

<p>For the rest, we may boldly assert that the very
terms of the German ultimatum prove, without possible
doubt, that she did not believe in the danger
of a French irruption into Belgium. For if she had
entertained this conviction she would have said to
Belgium: "I warn you that if you do not take the
necessary measures to resist the entrance of the
French I shall be fully authorized to invade your
territory in my turn, in order to defend myself." In
acting thus she would have had the right on her
side ... and the German diplomatists of the day
are certainly capable of distinguishing justice from
injustice in cases where the distinction is so easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>We say, therefore, that the imminence of a
French attack upon Belgium was only a pretext
and a bugbear; a pretext to justify the violation
of Belgium in the eyes of other nations; a bugbear
to catch votes of credit in the Reichstag
without previous discussion. "We were not able
to wait for this session before commencing hostilities
and invading Luxemburg, perhaps even Belgium,"
declared the Chancellor. Observe how
clumsy is this "perhaps"; the German troops
entered Belgium on the night of the 3rd of August
(1st <i>Grey Book</i>, No. 35), and on the afternoon of
the 4th, at the session of the Reichstag, the Chancellor
had no knowledge of it! We thought the
official telegraph service worked better than that in
Germany!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What, then, were the real reasons for invading our
country? They were strategic reasons, it is true,
but not those which the Chancellor indicated in his
speech! They had been known for a long time; the
German staff had always regarded a sudden attack
upon France as an unavoidable necessity, and for
that it was necessary at all costs to cross
Belgium. Moreover, on the very day when the
Chancellor was still invoking the French preparations
in the Reichstag, the Secretary of State, von
Jagow, openly avowed the true motive for violating
Belgium. The pamphlet of propaganda, <i xml:lang="de">Die Wahrheit
über den Krieg</i>, after invoking, without insisting
on, the danger of a French attack, described at
length the German plan of campaign; a sudden
attack upon France, delivered by passing through
Belgium; then, immediately after victory, a change
of front, and the crushing of the Russian Army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
The same idea is expounded in an infinity of
articles and pamphlets.</p>

<p>There can, therefore, be no remaining doubt as to
the determining motives of Germany: she wished
to pass through Belgium in order to fall upon
France before the latter was ready. Germany had
been preparing for war for several days, for she knew
that she had made the war inevitable, while France,
deceived by her adversary's peaceful professions of
faith, and, moreover, anxious to preserve the peace,
which she still believed to be possible, had hardly
commenced her mobilization. Let us recall the
comparison drawn by Mr. Lloyd George in his
speech at the City Temple on the 11th November,
1914. "Imagine," he said, "that your right-hand
neighbour came and made you the following proposal:
'See, my friend, I've got to cut the throat
of your left-hand neighbour. Only as his door is
barred I can't catch him unawares, and so I shall
lose my advantage over him. So you will do me
a little service; nothing that isn't entirely reasonable,
as you will see. You will just let me come
through your garden; if I trample down your
borders a little I'll have them raked and put in
good order again; and if by ill-luck I damage or
kill one of your children I promise you a nice little
indemnity.'"</p>

<p>And it is because we would not help Germany in
this task that she has spattered us with insults.
The Germans cannot understand how we could have
rejected her "well-intentioned" proposal, as the
Emperor calls it in his declaration of war. Evidently
they have ideas of honour which differ from
ours. We can regard this proposal only as an insult
to the Belgian people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>


<h3>C.&mdash;German Accusations against Belgium.</h3>

<p>There is one circumstance which aggravates the
evil deed which has soiled the German name. It
is the insistence with which the Press and the
politicians of Germany seek to cast the blame on
Belgium herself. For if we are to believe them
it was Belgium who began.</p>


<p><i>Necessity of influencing Neutrals.</i></p>

<p>When the German rulers discovered, to their utter
stupefaction, real or feigned, that America and the
other neutral States did not benevolently accept
the strategical excuse for the violation of Belgian
neutrality, their attitude underwent a sudden
modification. Since the whole world, in a spontaneous
impulse of indignation, branded the conduct
of Germany, the traitor and perjurer, in assailing a
nation which she was actually under an obligation
to protect, the German Government adopted the
classic procedure of evildoers, which consists in
reversing the rôles, and posing as an innocent victim,
driven into a corner by an adversary who does not
abide by legitimate methods of defence. What was
to be done in such a case? The German Government
must seem to believe, and then claim to
have proved, that Belgium had already violated her
own neutrality before the German invasion; for
then Germany could no longer be blamed for her
attitude.</p>


<p><i>Absurdity of the first Accusations.</i></p>

<p>Immediately the German newspapers invented
stories of French troops disentraining in Belgium
from the 30th July, 1914, and of French officers
teaching us how to handle Krupp guns!&mdash;of French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
airmen flying over Belgium, of French and Belgian
soldiers attacking the Landwehr at Aix-la-Chapelle
on the 2nd August, 1914. These pitiful accusations
were demolished by M. Waxweiler in <i xml:lang="fr">La Belge
Neutre et Loyale</i>. We will content ourselves with
remarking that all these infractions of neutrality are
anterior to the 4th of August. If they had really
been committed the innumerable spies scattered
about Belgium would have warned the German
Minister in Brussels, who would have telegraphed
to the Chancellor, and the latter would have taken
good care to make them the basis of a serious complaint
against Belgium in his speech to the
Reichstag. What weight would not these revelations
have lent to his arguments? If he did not
do thus it was because he was not informed, and
if he was not informed it was because the facts were
non-existent. They were invented&mdash;very clumsily,
moreover&mdash;after the event.</p>

<p>If now we cast a glance at the tales which the
Germans have imagined to extenuate their crime
against justice, we shall say, with a certain professor
of Utrecht (<i>K.Z.</i>, 4th November, first morning
edition), that one might with difficulty have pardoned
the German rulers for violating Belgian neutrality
if it had been proved that imperious strategic necessities
compelled them to it, but that they should have
stuck to their original declarations, "for," he adds,
"we have been painfully impressed by all the offences
which have been alleged after the event to demonstrate
that Germany had the right to act as she
did."</p>

<p>To insult and calumniate an innocent person in
order to excuse oneself is an attitude little worthy
of a self-respecting nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>


<p><i>A Change of Tactics. The Revelations of the</i>
N.A.Z.</p>

<p>Week by week the German journals add an item
to the indictment of Belgium. One would say that
their method of reasoning must be as follows: "Since
we cannot bring forward a single convincing proof,
let us accumulate as many as possible of any degree
of value; we shall end by crushing Belgium with
the weight of evidence." In order that we might
judge of the efficacy of this procedure, Germany
ought, of course, to tell us how many bad arguments
are to her thinking worth one good one.</p>

<p>Yet it was extremely important that Germany
should be able to bring forward proof of the crime
of Belgium; for directly the neutrals, and in particular
America, began to doubt our political honesty
they would withdraw their sympathies and leave our
executioners full liberty of action. At the same time
Germany would be able to pretend that she knew of
Belgium's intrigues, and that by invading our
territory in spite of treaties she was not, properly
speaking, committing a treacherous act.</p>

<p>There are reasons for supposing that Germany
herself was conscious of the insufficiency of these
accusations. Hence the change of tactics which
we observe after the month of October 1914.</p>

<p>The Government itself entered into the lists.
In its official organ, the <i xml:lang="de">Norddeutsche Allgemeine
Zeitung</i>, it commented upon the documents discovered
in the Ministries of Brussels.</p>

<p>To judge of the relevance of this collection of
documents we must keep in mind the two following
points: (1) That England played the part of protector
of Belgian neutrality; (2) the probability of a German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
invasion in case of war between France and Germany.
Let us rapidly examine these.</p>

<p>1. <i>England as the Guarantor of Belgian Neutrality.</i>&mdash;Every
one knows that for centuries England has
been interested, more than any other nation, in
ensuring that Belgium should not be annexed either
to France or to Prussia.</p>

<p>As far back as 1677, says Sorel (<i xml:lang="fr">L'Europe et la
Révolution française</i>, vol. i. p. 338), a French agent
in London wrote to Louvois: "It has been voted
unanimously by the Lower Chamber that the English
will sell their very shirts (this is the phrase they
use) to make war on France for the preservation
of the Low Countries." During the French Revolution,
and later, under the Empire, the struggle
between England and France was largely provoked
by the desire to turn France out of Belgium.</p>

<p>The Treaty of London (1839) makes no distinction
between the five guarantors of our neutrality:
Austria, France, Great Britain, Prussia, and Russia;
but it is none the less unanimously admitted that
England has the most immediate interest in the
preservation of our independence, as it matters
greatly to England that Antwerp&mdash;that loaded
pistol aimed at the heart of England, as Napoleon
used to say&mdash;should become neither French nor
German.</p>

<p>Therefore, as soon as Belgium was threatened by
an armed invasion, the traditional policy of England
was at once invoked.</p>

<p>It was in virtue of this policy that Great Britain,
in 1870, demanded of France and Germany whether
they engaged themselves to maintain the neutrality
of Belgium. The two belligerents gave and kept
their promise. France, driven up against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Belgium frontier at Sedan, did not even then
consider that she had the right to break her word;
she preferred to allow herself to be crushed. If ever
there were "strategic reasons" which would excuse
the breaking of a promise, it was then!</p>

<p>All this being so, no one was surprised when in
August 1914 the newspapers announced that
England had put the usual question to France and
Germany. This time again France made the reply
inspired by her sense of honour; Germany refused
to commit herself.</p>

<p>The historical facts which we have recalled suffice
to show that the protective rôle of England was not
invented for the needs of the moment, as Germany
would have the world believe. The Chancellor
cannot be ignorant of these facts; they are known
to all. Why then does he persist in asserting that
England would not have intervened had France
been the country to violate our neutrality?</p>

<p>2. <i>The danger of a German Invasion.</i>&mdash;For several
years German generals have been agreed in admitting
the necessity of marching the German army
across Belgium in case of war with France.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In
military circles this was a <i xml:lang="fr">secret de polichinelle</i>, as
the <i>N.R.C.</i> remarked on the 22nd December, 1914
(evening edition).</p>

<p>Moreover, the Germans themselves held that the
Belgians could not have been ignorant of the threat
of a German invasion; this idea is expounded,
notably, in a booklet of official aspect, entitled <i xml:lang="fr">La
part de la culpabilité de l'Angleterre dans la guerre
mondiale</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>Belgium therefore had serious reasons for expecting
a German attack. There was evidently only one
thing for her to do: to demand assistance of the
country which had constituted itself the protector of
her neutrality, and on which she had always been
accustomed to rely with unshakable confidence.</p>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Report of M. le Baron Greindl, sometime
Belgian Minister in Berlin.</span></h3>

<p><i>Falsification of the Greindl Report.</i></p>

<p>On the 14th October, 1914, the German Government
posted on the walls of Brussels a placard
entitled: <i>England and Belgium</i> (<i>Documents found
at the headquarters of the Belgian Staff</i>). A reproduction
of this placard was distributed gratuitously,
thousands of copies being issued the same day.
This document contains, first, a rapid summary of
a report on the relations which existed in 1906
between the Belgian Chief of Staff and the British
military attaché. Then the placard reproduces,
"word for word," a portion of a report made by
M. Greindl, dated the 23rd December, 1911. In
this report M. Greindl warns the Belgian Government
of the possibility of a French attack.</p>

<p>Whosoever will attentively read the exhibited
portion of this report will at once remark that its
phrases lack connection and logical sequence. Thus,
there is certainly a hiatus between the opening
phrases and those that begin with: "When it
became evident that we should not allow ourselves
to be alarmed by the pretended danger of closing
the Scheldt, the plan was not abandoned, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
modified, in the sense that the English army of
assistance would not be disembarked on the Belgian
coast, but in the nearer French ports." Now what
is meant by this "pretended danger"? Pretended
by whom? And then "we should not allow
ourselves to be alarmed." Who is "we?" Remark
that a few lines farther on the report speaks of the
eventuality of a battle between the Belgian army
and the British army; Belgium, which was just now
the ally of the British, is now their adversary,
although nothing indicates how she passed from the
first attitude to the second. In the same sentence
the closing of the Scheldt is spoken of with an
English landing on the <i>Belgian coast</i>; yet we cannot
imagine M. Greindl placing Antwerp on the Belgian
coast. Can we doubt after this that phrases have
been suppressed in this portion of the document?
Evidently not; for it is radically impossible to
realize the bearing and the meaning of the report
by reading the portion published. What, then, is
the conclusion forced upon us? It is that the
German Government has "cooked" the text;
omitting to copy certain passages which would not
tally with the deductions which it wished to draw
from it, and that it has perhaps even twisted the
meaning of certain phrases.</p>

<p>The publication of the complete report was
demanded by the Belgian Government (see <i>K.Z.</i>,
24th October, first morning edition). But Germany
refused; the report was too long, it replied, by the
medium of the <i>N.A.Z.</i> (25th November, 1914). All
that could be obtained was the publication in
facsimile, in the same issue of the <i>N.A.Z.</i>, of the
heading and the two first lines. Since the German
Government did not publish the rest, we have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
right to conclude that this was because it had
subjected the document to falsifications such as
were introduced in that we are now about to
consider. In any case, the report as it was published
means nothing. One feels that it was intentionally
made confusing. By whom?</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Reports of Generals Ducarne and
Jungbluth.</span></h3>

<p>The falsifications inserted in these documents
by the German diplomatists have already been
lucidly exposed (for example, by E. Brunets,
<i xml:lang="fr">Calomnies Allemandes</i>); so there would be no need
to return to the subject, had not the German
Government thought fit to attempt to use these
documents in order to demoralize the Belgians.</p>

<p>At the end of December 1914, and in January
1915, Germany distributed hundreds of thousands
of copies of a pamphlet containing several documents,
among which were translations (into Flemish
and French) and facsimiles of the Ducarne and
Jungbluth reports. The famous words of the
"reference" are replaced in their natural position
in the middle of the fourth paragraph,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> but&mdash;and
this was a wholly unexpected discovery&mdash;they were
also found in the commentary. According to the
copy in the text, one reads: "The document bears
on the margin: 'The entrance of the English into
Belgium would take place only after the violation
of our neutrality by Germany.'"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>Disconcerting fecundity of Kultur! The Germans
have reason to be proud of their chemical industry.
Thanks to a special fertilizer prepared in the offices
of Wilhelmstrasse, the famous phrase, which occurs
only once in the original document, is promptly
multiplied and is able to appear twice over.</p>


<p><i>The Attitude of the Belgians toward the German
Falsifications.</i></p>

<p>Note that to give more weight to their explanations
the Germans were careful to have them
printed in Flemish and in French, on the paper
and with the type habitually employed by the
<i xml:lang="fr">Moniteur belge</i>. It is then, in the last resort, the
Belgian public which has paid the cost of printing
this falsification of a public document. Well, well!
they have mistaken our psychology, for despite
these "revelations" our conviction is unshaken.
Not a Belgian has criticized the actions of his
Government in respect of the defensive agreement
with England. It would be like blaming a man
whose house was destroyed by fire for having insured
it with a reliable insurance company.</p>

<p>Confronted by the failure of their endeavours to
discourage the Belgians and to embroil them with
their legitimate Government, Germany returned to
the charge. A placard dated 10th March, 1915,
posted in Brussels, stated that the Belgian statesmen
replied to the publication of the Ducarne and
Jungbluth reports only after the lapse of three
months. The placard evidently alludes to the
Belgian Note of the 13th January, 1915 (<i>see</i> the
2nd <i>Grey Book</i>, No. 101). Now the first sentence
of this Note states that the Belgians had already
replied on the 4th December, 1914. Germany could
not have been unaware of this reply; let us add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that we ourselves knew of it on the 10th December,
thanks to the issue for the 7th of <i xml:lang="fr">L'Indépendance
Belge</i> (appearing in London), which was smuggled
into Brussels.</p>

<p>The third document contained in the pamphlet
of the German Government related to the <i>military
geographical manuals</i>.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It shows that a final collaboration
(after the violation of her engagements
by Germany) was carefully devised by the British
and Belgian staffs. Truly it ill becomes the
Germans, so proud of the introduction of their
scientific method into the art of war, which leaves
nothing unthought of, to reproach others for acting
in the same way, and for making meticulous preparations
at an opportune time! In two places the
article insists on the fact that the preparations of
these manuals was effected in "time of peace."
But come! should the Belgians and the British
have waited until the Germans were in Belgium
before thinking of measures of defence?</p>

<p>Finally, the pamphlet contains <i>Fresh and Serious
Proofs demonstrating the complicity of Belgium and
England</i>. Documents were found on the escritoire
of the British Legation in Brussels relating to the
Belgian mobilization, the defence of Antwerp, and
the French mobilization. The accusation is this:
these documents were found in the British Legation,
a proof that the Belgian Government had no military
secrets from the British Government, and that
they had a close military understanding.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>Once again: was Belgium, aware of the Germanic
peril, to deliver herself bound hand and foot to the
invader, who, not content with forgetting his international
obligations, was about to run precisely
counter to them? It would evidently have been
more agreeable to Germany to have found in Belgium
a lamb all ready to allow itself to be sacrificed on
the altar of <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>. Unhappily for <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>, Belgium
behaved like an enraged ram, determined to sell its
life dearly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whatever aspect of the question of Belgian
neutrality we may consider, we always come back
to this fact: Germany violated this neutrality on
the 4th August, although Belgium had given her no
plausible excuse for doing so. Since then the
Germans have undertaken a campaign for the
purpose of justifying their "injustice," as their
Chancellor termed it. But none of the accusations
invented after the event can in the slightest degree
extenuate this injustice; their only effect has been
to render still more execrable the treachery of the
perjured protector.</p>


<p><i>Neutral Opinion.</i></p>

<p>It is pleasant, in this connection, to cite here
the opinion of four writers belonging to countries
which have not taken part in the war.</p>

<p>A Dutch writer published in <i xml:lang="nl">De Amsterdammer</i>
an interesting article which was translated into
French, but of which the sale in Belgium was
immediately prohibited by the Germans.</p>

<p>In a lecture which has achieved a very great
celebrity, Herr Karl Spitteler, a well-known literary
man of German-speaking Switzerland, also took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
part of Belgium. We know of this lecture only by
the slashing which it received in the <i>K.Z.</i> on the
30th December, in the first morning edition.</p>

<p>Here is a passage which particularly infuriated the
German paper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I consider that to take the documents from the
pockets of the gasping victim (Belgium) is, as to
the spirit which inspired the act, a gross fault of
taste. It would have been quite enough to throttle
the victim; to blacken him afterwards is too much.
As for Switzerland, if it associated itself with these
calumnies against Belgium, it would commit not
merely an infamy, but a mistake; for on the day
when another Power grudges us our national
existence, the same accusations might be employed
against us: do not let us forget that malice is now
counted among the munitions of war."</p>

<p>Another Swiss writer, M. Philippe Godet, expresses
his opinions with no less energy in the <i xml:lang="fr">Journal de
Genève</i> (8th September, 1914).</p>


<p><i>The Falsification of M. de l'Escaille's Letter.</i></p>

<p>In the preceding pages we have dealt only with
matters relating to Belgium. Do not let our
attitude be misunderstood. We have not the presumption
to suppose that Belgium has ever occupied
the foreground in the negotiations described; on the
contrary, we are perfectly well aware of the diplomatic
insignificance of our country in the discordant
"Concert of Europe" which has ended in the
present war. Our sole object is to show that
Belgium has not played the unavowable rôle which
the Germans attributed to her. As to the origin of
this war, and the responsibility which the German
rulers seek to foist upon Great Britain, in order that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
their own country, and, above all, their ally, Austria,
may evade it, this is a discussion into which we do
not wish to enter, for it lies outside the programme
which we have set ourselves. We ought, however,
to speak a word as to the placards which the
German authorities had posted up in Belgium during
the month of September 1914. The first is dated
the 16th September; it gives the résumé of a letter
written by M. B. de l'Escaille to the Belgian Minister
of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>Ten days later a new placard appeared: this time
the complete text of the letter was given, and it was
explained how it came to fall into the hands of the
Germans.</p>

<p>Let us leave this last point: it concerns the
criminal law, not diplomacy. Let us examine only
the summary which was published and the conclusions
which the Germans drew from it.</p>

<p>Was the summary honest? To discover this let
us take the essential sentence, printed in heavier
type: "They possess even the definite assurance
that England will come to the assistance of
France"; and let us compare this with the corresponding
passage of the text: "To-day they are
strongly convinced in St. Petersburg, they even
have the assurance, that England will support
France." The term "assistance" (<i xml:lang="fr">secouer</i>) in the
summary can apply only to military assistance,
while the text speaks only of "support" (<i xml:lang="fr">soutien</i>),
which means diplomatic action. So the second conclusion
also is false&mdash;"that England did not intervene
in the war on account of Belgium, but because
she had promised France to give her assistance."</p>

<p>Let us now look at the first conclusion. It is
"that Germany was actuated by pacific intentions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and sought by all means to avoid war." In reality
the text, like the summary, states only that Germany
sought to avoid a general conflict, which means that
she wished to localize the war between Austria and
Serbia; in other words, Germany wished Europe to
give Austria a free hand to crush Serbia. Nowhere
does the text say that Germany did anything to
avoid "the war": the only war which was declared
on the 30th July, that of Austria against Serbia. In
short, this conclusion is falsified.</p>

<p>There remains the phrase which introduces the
two conclusions: "By this report of the diplomatic
representative of Belgium at the Court of St.
Petersburg it is proved".... Was M. de l'Escaille
really the diplomatic representative of Belgium in
St. Petersburg? Open an administrative almanack,
and you will see that <i>the</i> representative was M.
le Comte Conrad de Buisseret-Steenbecque de
Blarenghien. As for M. de l'Escaille, he was
Secretary of Legation.</p>

<p>The conclusions concluding here, there is no
room for further falsifications.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not our intention to make an exhaustive
examination of the diplomatic documents relating
to the war; the more so as this examination has
been conducted in masterly fashion by MM. Dürckheim
and Denis, by M. Waxweiler, and by the
author of <i xml:lang="fr">J'Accuse</i>. It is enough for us to prove
that Germany has intentionally falsified documents,
since this simple proof disposes of all her attempts to
befoul Belgium; for he who has a good argument at
his disposal is not so foolish as to spoil it and deprive
it of all real value by means of falsifications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<h3>D.&mdash;The Declaration of War and the first Hostilities.</h3>

<p><i>The three Successive Proposals of Wilhelm II to
Belgium.</i></p>

<p>Under its dry, cold, diplomatic phrasing the reply
to the ultimatum (1st <i>Grey Book</i>, No. 22) scarcely
conceals the indignation which thrilled the heart of
Belgium when Wilhelm II offered her the chance of
associating herself with his crime against loyalty.
But the German Government did not understand
this indignation, neither was it conscious of its own
infamy. Otherwise how could it have repeated the
same offer a few days later&mdash;an offer at once contemptible
and full of contempt, as was so well said
by M. Jules Destrée before the meeting of the
Federation of Advocates, on the 3rd August, 1914.
Two remarks on the subject of this fresh proposal
(1st <i>Grey Book</i>, No. 60). In the first place the
United States Minister in Belgium, who was entrusted
with the German interests, refused to
transmit it; as for the Dutch Minister of Foreign
Affairs, he accepted the mission "without enthusiasm."
In the second place, when the Emperor
affirmed, on the 9th August, that the fortress of
Liége had been taken by assault, he must have
known that the fortress was still resisting; for
although the <i>city</i> of Liége was occupied by the
Germans from the 7th, the <i>forts</i> were intact. Let
us remember that the first fort which fell was
that of Barchon, on the 8th August, 1914; that
of Évegnée fell on the 11th, that of Fléron on the
14th, that of Loncin, commanded by General Leman,
fell only at 5 p.m. on the 15th: and several forts
were at that time still holding out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>German diplomacy naturally received a fresh
indignant refusal (1st <i>Grey Book</i>, No. 23).</p>

<p>Even then official Germany, dazzled by the brilliance
of its <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>, had not yet grasped the full
baseness of its crime, since on the 10th September it
posted up in Brussels its new proposal and Belgium's
reply.</p>

<p>Could candour in perfidy go any farther? Yes!
for the German Government, during the siege of
Antwerp, made proposals of peace for the third
time. This offer was secret. The terms have not
been published; even the Germanic Press sought to
deny that it had been made; but the avowal
appeared in a Viennese newspaper, the <i xml:lang="de">Neue Freie
Presse</i>, and was reproduced by order of the German
authorities in <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique</i> (Brussels, 13th January,
1915).</p>


<p><i>Hostilities preceding the Declaration of War.</i></p>

<p>So the Emperor Wilhelm II did not succeed in
making us his accomplices. Needless to say, we
did not tremble before the two bogies which are
given so large a place in his harangues: his store
of dry powder and his newly-whetted sabre.</p>

<p>And so the sovereign of the formidable German
Empire declared war upon tiny Belgium. "He would
find himself, to his keenest regret, obliged to execute,
if need be by force of arms, the measures of security
set forth as indispensable," as the declaration of war
expressed it (1st <i>Grey Book</i>, No. 27). This declaration
reached Brussels at 7 a.m. on the 4th of
August. But, apparently unknown to the Emperor,
the German troops, before the telegram had reached
Belgium, had crossed the frontier during the night of
the 3rd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>We have just seen that the declaration of war
reached Brussels on the 4th August, at seven o'clock
in the morning. This, at least, is what we learn
from the official documents published by Belgium.
What does official Germany say upon this point?
Nothing. Nowhere is any mention made of the
declaration of war, and it is this intentional
vagueness which allows the Germans to declare,
without blushing, that the German troops entered
Belgium on the night of the 3rd August. They let
it be supposed that the state of war existed from
the moment when Belgium, on the 3rd, refused the
German ultimatum. Thus the <i xml:lang="de">Chronik des Deutschen
Krieges</i> (p. 33) gives the text of the ultimatum;
then, in two lines, a summary of the reply. The
first document which follows relating to Belgium is
the proclamation of the Commander-in-Chief of the
Army of the Meuse (<i>6th Report</i>, I).</p>

<p>This is very vague as to the political relations
between the two countries: are they at war, or are
they not? No one could say. Of the declaration of
war, which should have found a place here, not a
word; there is no further question of Belgium before
the telegrams of the 7th August (p. <a href="#Page_84">84</a>).</p>

<p>When we say that the declaration of war is not
mentioned in any German publication, we are going
too far. <i xml:lang="de">Die Wahrheit über den Krieg</i> ("die Wahrheit!")
speaks of the declaration of war; but only
to say that Belgium declared war (p. 40): <i xml:lang="de">Belgiën
antwortete darauf mit der Kriegserklärung</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p>The same publication appends some documents;
No. 41 (p. 160) is a reproduction of the ultimatum.
One would naturally expect that No. 42 would be
either Belgium's reply or the declaration of war.
By no means; these two documents are not given.
Any one who reads the text and hopes thereby to
learn "<i xml:lang="de">die Wahrheit</i>" concerning the war will be no
better informed by the documents. Let us in passing
remark that the German Government, in the <i>White
Book</i> published for the session of the Reichstag of
the 4th August, had also, by its own admission,
made a selection among the documents which it
submitted to the members of Parliament. This
procedure is no doubt a logical consequence of
<i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>.</p>


<p><i>The Pacific Character of Belgium.</i></p>

<p>Nearly all the nations of Europe cherish national
animosities, racial hatreds handed down from century
to century, the heritage of conflicts never pacified,
which a mere nothing suffices to renew; or the survival
of oppressions and spoliations suffered of old by
men's forbears, whose abhorred memory is transmitted
like a sacred trust from generation to generation.
And in all these countries, moreover, there is a
chauvinist, a jingo party, which urges a "war of
revenge against the hereditary enemy." In Belgium,
as Mr. Asquith stated in his speech in Dublin, there
was nothing of the kind. We had no spite against
any one, and our people, laborious and peaceful, only
asked to be allowed to live in friendship with its
neighbours. Never had there been in Belgium any
manifestation against a foreign country; never had
a political party inscribed in its programme any sort
of hostility towards another people. Who, then, will
be persuaded that "the Belgian Government had for
a long time been carefully preparing for this war,"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
as the Emperor Wilhelm II asserted in his telegram
to the President of the United States (in which he
also stated that his heart was bleeding!)? No, there
is no possible doubt on this point: Belgium brought
into the conflict no racial enmity,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and if she has
found herself thrown into the furnace, despite her
constant love of peace, it is solely because her
haughty neighbour confronted her with this dilemma:
either peace with dishonour, or honour with
war. The choice was not in doubt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p><i>German Espionage in Belgium.</i></p>

<p>It is idle to insist on the accusation of premeditation,
for it is unhappily too certain that Belgium was
is no way ready for war. But it is also incontestable
that Germany had "for a long time carefully prepared
for" the invasion of Belgium. We cannot as
yet reveal in detail the facts as to German espionage,
with its often odious methods, for in most
cases these revelations would expose those who have
informed us to reprisals. We must for the present
be intentionally vague, reserving preciser details for a
later date.</p>

<p>When the occupation comes to an end we shall
report in detail the case of a German engineer,
who, in returning to us with the rank of officer, presided
over the systematic destruction by fire of the
workshop which he had managed; and the case of
another engineer, who commanded the gang ordered
to set fire to the quarter adjoining the factory in
which he had been employed. Thanks to his knowledge
of the locality, he was able in a few seconds to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>set fire to the richest streets of the neighbourhood.
We shall be able to mark on a map the foundations
of reinforced concrete for the great German guns,
constructed long in advance, in the localities most
favourable to bombardment; we shall also point to
the store of timber intended to serve for the construction
of a bridge over the Scheldt, which was
found in a factory established by Germans on the
banks of the river. As for the store of Mauser rifles
discovered at Liége, our newspapers spoke of that at
the time.</p>

<p>Here is a fact which can be related without danger.
A German officer dropped from his pocket&mdash;we shall
state later on in what locality&mdash;a detailed plan of the
town of Soignies, in which his troops had lodged a
few days earlier. This plan gives, besides the details
of streets, and even houses, information concerning
the occupants of certain buildings: pharmacies,
breweries, tanneries, the Communal treasury, the
bank, and other establishments where the army
might need to make requisitions. The large buildings
are coloured blue. It was there that the
troops were lodged. This plan, drawn in Chinese
ink and coloured, dates from fifteen years back
according to the indications which it contains. But
it has quite recently been revised and completed, for
the latest alterations in the town have been added in
pencil; improvement of the Senne, creation of a
public square, etc.</p>

<p>The case related by the <i>N.R.C.</i> of 19th August
(evening) is particularly instructive. When the
Germans occupied Liége and Seraing the Cockerill
workshops naturally refused to work for them, since
the Germans wished them to make munitions for
them. The German Colonel Keppel then assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the direction of the works, promising the workers an
increased salary of 50 per cent. And this officer did
not blush to sign his proclamation: "Attaché of the
German Government at the Liége Exposition." He
had consequently profited by his privileged situation
in Belgium in order to make himself familiar with the
organization of the Cockerill works. But it must be
supposed that matters were too difficult for him,
for Herren Koester and Noske (<i xml:lang="de">Kriegsfahrten</i>, p. 21)
assert that he had to abandon the position.</p>


<p><i>The Mentality of the German Soldiers at the
beginning of the Campaign.</i></p>

<p>Until the very last moment our enemies deluded
themselves as to the loyalty of the Belgians: they
still hoped that the latter would only resist as a
matter of form. This idea is openly expressed in the
Chancellor's speech of the 2nd December; it is also
implicitly contained in the proclamation of General
von Emmich (see <i>6th Report</i>, I). The officers and
soldiers who crossed the frontier at the beginning of
the war were quite bewildered by the unforeseen
resistance of the Belgian Army; this is what the
German prisoners interned at Bruges tell their relatives;
they even go so far as to deplore having to
fight a neutral country.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Letters from German Prisoners of War.</span></p>

<p>We hear from Belgium:&mdash;</p>

<p>The correspondence of the German prisoners of
war (to the number of about two thousand) who, at
the beginning of the war, were interned in the barracks
of the Bruges Lancers, has passed almost
entirely through our hands.</p>

<p>All say they are well treated. Some even hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that the Belgian prisoners in Germany will be as
well treated as they. One wounded soldier in a
Bruges hospital relates that the Belgians treat the
German wounded like brothers; another speaks only
of his "Belgian comrades"! The good food served
to them seems to make a great impression. Most of
them say, "We have enough to eat"; or even, "We
have food in abundance." Only one complains of
"beer without flavour and bad wine"; but another
says with much simplicity: "The people here are
very kind to us, for we have enough to eat and
drink." The word <i>for</i> is amusing....</p>

<p>The letters of the officers are quite different. No
more joy because their lives are safe. The war
absorbs them entirely. They are warriors at heart
and the struggle interests them passionately. They
know nothing of what is happening, or rather they
are not told what is happening, and they want to
know ... to know, and it is painful to hear in each
letter the same question: what news? The forced
inactivity becomes a torture. Boredom presses on
them: they are discouraged and greatly disillusioned;
they had hoped to pass very rapidly across
Belgium (it must be remembered that at this time
the war was only beginning, that Brussels was not
yet occupied, and that the letters date from this
period).</p>

<p>The attack upon Belgium does not seem to please
a great many of them. "We have attacked a neutral
country," says a medical officer, "and we shall
now have to suffer the eventual consequences."</p>

<p>"When we got out of the train," says another,
"we received the order to fight against Belgium, a
thing which is to me and to all highly antipathetic.
But what is commanded has to be executed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"The attack on Belgium was from the first a
shameful thing."</p>

<p>"We violated Belgium before any declaration of
war had been made"!</p>

<p>All the letters show how little the resistance of
Liége was expected. Many say: "Of all our company,
of our battalion, of our regiment, there are left
only so many or so many men." One relates how in
a few minutes his colonel, his major, the captains,
and nearly all the lieutenants were mown down by
the balls. "We are all mightily deluded," admits
another; "we were too confident; we thought the
Belgians were disheartened"! "The Belgians fight
like lions," says another.</p>


<p><i>German Lies respecting the Occupation of Liége.</i></p>

<p>It is the truth, although the news is partly from
a German source, that the Germans entered Belgium
on the night of the 3rd of August; they
crossed the frontier near Gemmenich at two o'clock
in the morning, and the following night (of the 4th
of August) they were already attempting an attack
upon Liége. But the official telegrams from Berlin
have never mentioned this date. To make it believed
that the capture of Liége was extremely rapid and
that the German army had met with no serious
resistance, the staff pruned the siege of Liége at
both ends; it made the operation commence on the
5th August instead of the 4th, and declared that it
was already completed by the 7th August.</p>

<p>We could not give a more precise idea of the
manner in which the Government and its "reptile
Press" deceives public opinion than by reproducing
two telegrams relating to the fall of Liége. On the
7th of August, having reported the entrance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
troops into Belgium on the previous day, the telegrams
announced the capture of the fortress of
Liége.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Note this: the capture of the <i>fortress</i>
(Festung). Now the Germans had merely occupied
the town of Liége, a town absolutely open,
without ramparts or defences of any kind. They
themselves were forced to own, on the 10th, that
the forts had not been captured; but they added
that the guns were no longer firing, which was false
(p. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <i>7th August</i>.&mdash;Our advance guard entered Belgium the
day before yesterday, along the whole frontier. A small division
attempted, with great valour, a surprise attack upon Liége. A
few cavalrymen pushed on into the city, and attempted to seize
the commandant, who was only able to escape by flight. The
surprise attack against the fortress, constructed according to
modern principles, did not succeed. Our troops are before
the fortress, in contact with the enemy. Naturally the whole
enemy Press will describe this enterprise as a defeat; but it
has no influence on the great operations; for us it is only
an isolated fact in the history of the war, and a proof of the
aggressive courage of our troops.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="de">Kr. D. des K. Z.</i>, p. 9.)<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <i>7th August</i>. Official. (<i>Wolff Agency.</i>)&mdash;The fortress
of Liége is taken. After the divisions, which had attempted a
surprise attack upon Liége, had been reinforced, the attack was
pushed to a successful termination. This morning at 8 o'clock
the fortress was in the power of Germany.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="de">Kr. D. des K. Z.</i>, p. 11.)<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it was necessary to prevent the bad
effect which would be produced on the population
by foreign communiqués announcing that the
German army was continuing to besiege Liége
after taking it. After the complete success announced
on the 7th the task was, in fact, rather
difficult. How was it to be effected?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Discredit might be thrown on news coming
from abroad, for example, by "demonstrating" its
untruthfulness. <i xml:lang="de">Der Lügenfeldzug</i> gives on p. 19 the
announcement of the taking of Liége, and on the
<i>following</i> page the Havas telegram stating that
Liége is not taken. What will the superficial
reader conclude if he does not take the trouble to
dissect the telegrams? That the Allies are shameless
liars, going to the length of denying the obvious.
But examine the dates: Liége was taken, according
to the Germans, on the 7th August, at 8 a.m., while
the Allies declare that Liége is not taken&mdash;on the
6th! And to think that the book which perpetrates
this trickery is entitled <i xml:lang="de">Der Lügenfeldzug unserer
Feinde</i> ("Our Enemies' Campaign of Lies")! and
that it undertakes the mission of calling attention
to the lies and calumnies of the enemy in order
to correct them!</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To establish confusion between the city and
the fortress. As early as the 7th August the false
newsmongers were rejoicing over the taking of the
fortress, intentionally confusing the city and the
fortified place, so that the reader of these communiqués
no longer knows what to think, and
naturally accepts the official news of his own
country.</p>


<p><i>The sudden Attack upon France is checked.</i></p>

<p>To understand how completely it was in Germany's
interest to create the belief that Liége was
taken in two days by a small body of troops, we
must remember that the object of the Germans was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to traverse Belgium as rapidly as possible, in order
to crush the French and capture Paris. The author
of <i xml:lang="fr">J'accuse</i> reports the remark of old Marshal von
Haeseler, who proposed to celebrate in Paris the
anniversary of Sedan&mdash;on the 2nd September, 1914.
We ourselves copied a charcoal inscription written
on the front of a house burned down at Battice,
making an appointment in Paris for the 2nd September
with a certain regiment of artillery.</p>

<p>Now this sudden march was completely spoiled
and the German plan of campaign undone by the
unexpected resistance of the Belgians, first at Liége,
then at Hesbays. This loss of a few days was fatal
to Germany, and Germany bears us malice on that
account.</p>


<p><i>The Disinterested Behaviour of Belgium.</i></p>

<p>One last point as to the violation of our neutrality.</p>

<p>The Germans now pretend to pity the poor
Belgians, who allowed themselves to be fooled by
England as much as by their King and Government,
and who, by their credulity, brought the war upon
themselves. But what am I saying?&mdash;the German
Government assures the world that we ourselves
desired the war. Official Germany has become
incapable of conceiving that a people should remain
faithful to its international obligations, and if need
be sacrifice itself for them.</p>

<p>"Why," our adversaries ask us, "did you not
accept the proposals of Germany? You would have
profited by them." And indeed our eastern neighbours
offered us £200,000 as the price of our
complicity (F. Bettix, <i xml:lang="de">Der Krieg</i>).</p>

<p>It would be very interesting to know on what
data Germany calculates the value of a nation's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
honour; in any case, we may assure her that no one
in the world would be so simple as to offer so great
a sum for hers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the rest, as far as we Belgians are concerned
our interest has never entered into our calculations.
It was not in order to profit by it that we resisted
Germany; it was because we judged that such was
our obligation as an honest nation. And yet, as the
Minister, M. Carton de Wiart, remarked, at the
Hotel de Ville in Paris, on the 20th December, 1914,
we had, even then, the vision of our country ravaged
by the Prussian hordes; but even to-day, after
suffering such terrible atrocities, there is not a
Belgian "who would change his poverty for the
profits of a bandit."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
VIOLATIONS OF THE HAGUE CONVENTION</h2>


<h3>A.&mdash;The "Reprisals against <span xml:lang="fr">Francs-tireurs</span>."</h3>

<p>Under the pretext that France was making ready
to attack her, Germany hastened to invade Belgium
and Luxemburg. But France was not preparing
to invade the Rhine provinces of Prussia, and this
pretended threat of aggression was merely a trick,
intended to frighten Parliament, and to obtain a
vote approving the actions of the Ministry and
giving it <i xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i>. The man&oelig;uvre completely
succeeded; the Government received a unanimous
vote, in spite of the Chancellor's admission: "We
are committing an injustice, and we are violating
the law of nations; but when one is driven into a
corner as we are, all means are good."</p>

<p>We discovered immediately, alas! what these
words meant. Hardly had the German soldiers
crossed the frontier, when they began to burn and
massacre.</p>


<p><i xml:lang="fr">Murders committed by the Germans from the outset.</i></p>

<p>On the very day of the invasion&mdash;the 4th August&mdash;a
motor-car carrying four German officers arrived
at Herve, and then pulled up. One of the officers
demanded information of a youth of sixteen, one
Dechêne; the latter did not understand, or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
refused to reply (which was his right, and even his
duty towards his country); we do not know, but in
any case the officer shot him with his revolver.</p>

<p>On the 4th of August, too, the Germans shot
peaceful citizens at Visé, when the 2nd battalion of
the 12th regiment of the line, under Major Collyns,
had the audacity to resist them. Of course they
pretended that the civilians took part in the
fighting. A few days later they burned the church
and the greater part of the town.</p>

<p>One sees plainly from these, and too many other
examples, what was the object of our enemies:
(<i xml:lang="fr">a</i>) They wished to terrorize the population, in order
to make them more amenable to requisitions and
demands of all kinds; (<i xml:lang="fr">b</i>) they wished to make their
own troops believe that in fighting the Belgians&mdash;which
they at first did with great unwillingness&mdash;they
were merely defending themselves against
treacherous attacks; (<i xml:lang="fr">c</i>) they wished to multiply
opportunities of pillage; (<i xml:lang="fr">d</i>) finally, perhaps, they
reckoned that by displaying to the Belgian Government
the horrors to which its first refusal had
exposed the country, they would induce it to
reconsider its position and could obtain from it a
free passage.</p>


<p><i xml:lang="fr">Were there any "<span xml:lang="fr">Francs-tireurs</span>"?</i></p>

<p>It would be impossible at this moment to state
that the Belgians never, at any point of the frontier,
fired upon the invaders. Let us remark, moreover,
that if they did they would have been, from the
purely human point of view, perfectly excusable.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>What! here is Germany, who, pretending to be in a
state of legitimate defence, falls unawares upon an
inoffensive third party! And this third party had
no right to oppose force to violence! In all logic,
was it not Belgium that was in a state of legitimate
defence; was it not for Belgium that all means were
good? And notice, please, that it was not against
an imagined and imaginary menace that we were
defending ourselves: the Germans had most undeniably
invaded Belgium. Would it have been
astonishing if the Belgians, exasperated by this
unspeakable aggression, had seized their rifles? In
sane justice, one could not regard such action as a
grievance; on the contrary. Does this mean that
we believe in the story of civilians attacking the
German army? Most certainly not; because we
know from reliable sources that in <i xml:lang="fr">every</i> case where
it has been possible to hold an inquiry, this inquiry
has shown that the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" were merely the
pretext; the real motive for all the devastation and
massacre was the desire to terrorize the population.
It is, therefore, in a fashion entirely theoretical, and
with the most express reserves, that we admit, in
default of opportunity to investigate, in each case,
the affirmations of our enemies, that in some cases,
certainly extremely rare, isolated civilians, or small
groups of civilians, may have been taken with arms
in their hands. But our enemies will please admit
also that the attitude of these civilians would have
been amply excused by the more than brutal fashion
in which the Germans behaved from the very first
moments of the war. Let us add that when one
erects terror into a system, as the Germans do, one
should understand the defensive reflexes of the
victims.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>What were the rights of our enemies in these
exceptional cases? They could, as they themselves
proclaim, have shot the individual offenders, and, for
once in a way, have burned their houses. But
nothing in the world could justify the executions
<i>en masse</i> and the wholesale burnings to which the
Germans surrendered themselves.</p>


<p><i>The Obsession of the "Franc-tireur" in the German
Army.</i></p>

<p>One point at first remained obscure to us in the
German "reprisals": how did the German officers
induce their men to commit this horrible carnage?
Very simply: their minds were worked upon beforehand;
they were crammed with legends of <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>
dating from the war of 1870-71, and were
made to believe that the Belgian population was
revoltingly brutal. So as soon as they set foot on
our territory they expected to be attacked by civilians,
and, very naturally, prepared to sell their lives
dearly.</p>

<p>Nothing is more typical in this respect than the
collection of soldiers' letters published for the edification
of the German nation in <i xml:lang="de">Der Deutsche Krieg in
Feldpostbriefen</i>.&mdash;<i xml:lang="de">I. Lüttich, Namur, Antwerpen.</i>
In more than half is there mention of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>";
but scarcely ever does the writer speak
of having himself seen them. Read, for example,
the first letter (that is No. 2 in the volume, for
Letter No. 1 is not a soldier's letter). The writer,
an officer, asserts that during the attack on the forts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of Liége, on the night of the 6th of August, the
night was so dark that it was impossible to distinguish
friends from enemies, and that the Germans
were firing on one another. Nevertheless, as they
were fired on, and as they saw three men running,
they immediately shot them as "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>."
During this same night their baggage-column having
been surprised (he does not say by whom), a village
was burned and the inhabitants were shot.</p>

<p>The whole mentality of the German soldier in
respect of civilians is reflected in this letter; it is so
dark that the Germans fire on one another, but that
does not prevent them from recognizing that those
attacking them are "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>," even though
their men are "falling <i xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>," which excludes all
idea of <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>.</p>

<p><span xml:lang="fr">Francs-tireurs</span>! From the very first days of the
war it is a fixed idea, an obsession, engendered by
previous reading and conversation, and carefully
nourished by the leaders.</p>


<p><i>The Obsession of the "Franc-tireur" in the
Literature of the War.</i></p>

<p><span xml:lang="fr">Francs-tireurs</span>! This idea invades the whole of
their contemporary literature. All the books on
the campaign in Belgium and France swarm with
tales of this kind. Let us add that the authors do
not assert that they themselves have seen the attacks
of the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>." But they have been told
of them, and they hasten to repeat the story without
the slightest means of verification.</p>

<p>Thus, in <i xml:lang="de">Kriegsfahrten</i>, by Herren Koester and
Noske, there is mention of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" on
pages 10, 12, 13, 20, and 22; and they return to the
subject in the last chapter (p. 113).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Herr Fedor von Zobeltitz, in <i xml:lang="de">Kriegsfahrten eines
Johanniters</i>, also constantly heard mention of attacks
by Belgian civilians: at Tirlemont (p. 39), at
Louvain (pp. 39, 53, 54, 91), at Malines (p. 49),
at Eppeghem (p. 86), and in Antwerp (p. 154).</p>

<p>The volume entitled <i xml:lang="de">Die Eroberung Belgiëns</i> is
full of stories of the same sort. Thus, of thirty-eight
illustrations, which are neither maps nor portraits,
ten are devoted to the attacks of Belgian civilians.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the tales of people who
have not been present in the battles fought in Belgium,
and who speak only from hearsay, with the
narrative of Herr Otto von Gottberg, <i xml:lang="de">Als Adjutant
durch Frankreich und Belgiën</i>. He took part in
September in the battles which accompanied the
siege of Antwerp. Nowhere did he see <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>.
Yet he by no means loves the Belgian civilians, and
he certainly would have been tremendously pleased
to shoot down a few. Read, for example, what he
says of the provocative attitude of the people of
Brussels, and above all of the women of Brussels
(p. 55), and of passing through the streets of Lebbeke
(near Termonde), where his soldiers proposed to fall
upon the inhabitants who scowled at them (p. 65).
However, he says, he did not burn a single house
(p. 67). We may remark that Herr Gottberg's
companions showed themselves less amiable, or at
least equitable, than he, for the "reprisals" against
Lebbeke were particularly atrocious (see <i>9th Report</i>).
It is, however, highly improbable that the inhabitants
would have deprived themselves of the pleasure of
firing on the little patrol led by Herr Gottberg,
afterwards to take up arms against troops which
were much more numerous. However it may be,
the legend of the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" of Lebbeke was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
willingly accepted by Herren Koester and Noske
(<i xml:lang="de">Kriegsfahrten</i>).</p>


<p><i>The Obsession of the "Franc-tireur" in Literature
and Art.</i></p>

<p>The obsession of the "franc-tireur" is also found
outside the limits of military literature properly
so-called. Herr Bredt has just published a book on
<i xml:lang="fr">Le caractère du peuple belge révélé par l'art belge</i>.
The illegal attacks of the Belgian population upon
the regular German troops, he says, were not in the
least surprising to those who were acquainted with
the productions of Belgian art.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to surpass, in this respect, an
article which appeared in the January number of
<i xml:lang="de">Kunst und Künstler</i>. It gives the reproduction of
an engraving by Callot: a camp in which musketeers
are putting to death condemned men bound to stakes.
"Execution of <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>," says the legend in
German. That there should be a question of
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" in the time of Callot, who died
in 1635, may in itself seem somewhat strange. But
the engraver has taken care to inscribe, under his
work, some lines describing the scene which it
represents, which may be translated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Those who to give their evil nature sway,<br />
Failing in duty, take the tyrant's way,<br />
Infringing right, delighting but in ill,<br />
Whose acts are full of treason and self-will,<br />
Cause in the camp full many a bloody brawl,<br />
So die this death, the end of traitors all."<br />
</div>

<p>It is enough to read this legend to realize that
they are traitors who are being punished; but the
German mind of to-day is so steeped in the idea of
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" that the artists no longer understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
what their predecessors wrote, and, like the
soldiers, they see <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span> everywhere.</p>


<p><i>Responsibility of the Leaders.</i></p>

<p>But it is above all the great massacres of
Andenne, Tamines, Dinant, Termonde, Aerschot,
Louvain, and Luxemburg, which are for ever inexcusable,
and will remain, an eternal disgrace, as a
stain upon the German flag. Their appetite whetted
by the atrocities committed during the first days of
the invasion, the soldiers themselves invented or
simulated attacks of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>," in order
to have the pleasure of afterwards repressing them,
killing, pillaging, and burning entire cities. Let us
say, to be just, that not the soldiers but their leaders
will bear, before the bar of history, the responsibility
of this revival of the monstrosities of barbarism. Is
it not obvious that in an army as highly disciplined
as the German, an army in which the officers
drive their men into battle under the threat of
their revolvers, and in which the soldiers obey such
injunctions, such deliberately prepared tragedies as
that of Louvain are possible only with the complicity
of the officers, or rather by their orders?
How else can we conceive that soldiers would post
themselves in a garden and thence fire their rifles
into the streets? (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 10th September, 1914,
evening edition). And it is not the subaltern officers
that we have to call to account for these butcheries,
but the generals, such as Baron von Bissing, since
become Governor-General of Belgium, who counsels
the soldiery to show themselves pitiless, and not to
allow themselves to be swayed by any humanitarian
consideration, for compassion would be an act of
treason (<i>compare</i> p. <a href="#Page_336">336</a>). The soldiers are advised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that it is permissible for them "to make the
innocent suffer with the guilty" (p. <a href="#Page_84">84</a>); that
they may hang, without further ceremony, those
who have committed the crime of being found
present, for whatever reason, in a house where
munitions or arms have been found (p. <a href="#Page_335">335</a>); and
also those who have attempted to escape while they
were being held as hostages (p. <a href="#Page_151">151</a>). The previous
Governor-General of Belgium announced that soldiers
need not be sure whether suspects are accessories
or not, but that "if any hostility is displayed
towards them they may raze a city to the ground."
Such is the fate that General von Bülow promised
the city of Brussels. The same general thought it
incumbent upon him officially to inform the people
of Brussels, Liége, and Namur that it was with his
consent that the town of Andenne was burned, and
about one hundred persons shot (<i>6th Report</i>, IV).</p>

<p>By these proclamations and others equally sanguinary
the military authorities wished to influence
both the Germans and the Belgians. The former
were absolved beforehand of the horrors they committed,
and were assured of impunity for all the
"reprisals" they might be pleased to undertake.
Moreover, they were kept in perpetual horror of
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>." Are they assailed unexpectedly by
soldiers of the enemy's army? They fall back without
assuring themselves of what has really happened, and
return with the main body of the army to expend their
rage against the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>." This is what took
place at Tamines where more than four hundred
citizens were shot down by rifle or machine-gun fire,
and also in a dozen villages of Bas-Luxembourg,
which were razed to the ground, and in which a
thousand inhabitants were shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Animosity toward the Clergy.</i></p>

<p>The military chiefs bear an especial grudge against
the clergy. In the manifestoes against "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"
the priests are specially mentioned, which
amounts to recommending them quite specially to
the savagery of the troops. The latter are convinced
that the priests incite their flocks from the
pulpit, and that they place machine-guns in the
belfries. So, in the sack of a village, the worst
treatment is always reserved for the priests and
the churches.</p>

<p>The pastoral letter of His Excellency Cardinal
Mercier gives a list of forty-three priests shot or
executed.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>There is no ignominy the troops have not inflicted
on the priests. A few examples among hundreds
will suffice.</p>

<p>They forced members of the Louvain clergy to lie
naked in the dung of a pig-sty.</p>

<p>The curé of Pont-Brûlé was beaten, by order
of the German soldiery, by his own parishioners.</p>

<p>The January number of <i xml:lang="de">Kunst und Künstler</i> gives
a drawing representing a curé hanging from a tree.</p>

<p>At Cortemarck it was the priests who were
punished because an inhabitant was in communication
with the enemy (read, "the Belgians").</p>

<p>On the 30th August, 1914, the Germans arrested
the dean and vicar of a village in Brabant, under the
pretext that they had made luminous signals from
the church tower. Now the priests had been
prisoners since 2.0 o'clock of the afternoon; how
then could they have ascended the tower at
5.30 p.m.? Despite their protestations they were
taken to Louvain, whence a so-called Council of
War sent them to Germany. Arriving in a prisoners'
camp, they were accommodated in the latrines,
which consisted of a trench and a plank perforated
with holes. Each time a German soldier had to
satisfy his need, he took the opportunity of insulting
the priests in the most filthy manner. A German
major sent for them and informed them that they
were about to be shot. The vicar asked that he
might confess. "No," he was told, "hell is good
enough for you." They were led away to die ...
but were sent to a seminary, where they remained
prisoners until January 1915.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Animosity toward Churches.</i></p>

<p>Against the churches their rage was unloosed with
even greater fury. In the part of Brabant that lies
north of Vilvorde there is hardly a belfry left erect:
Beyghem, Capelle-au-Bois, Haecht, Humbeek, Pont-Brûlé,
Sempst, Eppeghem, Houtem, Weerde,
Hofstade, Elewijt, Werchter, Boortmeerbeek, etc.,
are all burned.</p>

<p>At Termonde all the churches have been either
burned or profaned. But in the midst of this city,
where twelve hundred houses were burned out of
fourteen hundred, the Béguinage remained intact, an
oasis of calm isolated amid the calcined ruins. On the
grassy plain that surrounds the bright little houses
of the béguines stood the chapel. This did not find
favour with the Germans, and its blackened walls
attest that <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i> has passed that way. Were
the béguines perhaps "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"?</p>

<p>We have already stated that the peculiar irritation
of the Germans against the clergy and their sanctuaries
was due to the fact that they regarded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
curés as the leaders of the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>." The
falsity of this allegation was recognized by Dr. Julius
Bachem, the editor of the <i xml:lang="de">Kölnische Volkszeitung</i>,
one of the most prominent Catholic newspapers in
Germany. Dr. Bachem published, in the issue for
April 1915 of the <i xml:lang="de">Süddeutsche Monatshefte</i>, which
was principally devoted to Belgium, an article on
the religious problem in Belgium. He based his
proofs on the authority of Baron von Bissing,
Commandant of the 7th Army Corps, at present
Governor-General in Belgium, and also on the
special inquiry undertaken by the Union of the
Catholic Priests of the Rhine, <i>Pax</i>. This inquiry,
mostly conducted with the aid of the present military
authorities in Belgium, proved that the clergy was
absolutely innocent, and that all the accusations
brought against it were purely imaginary.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor did not wait for the confirmation
of the crimes attributed to the priests before making
violent accusations against them in his telegram to
the President of the United States. He has not
retracted these.</p>


<p><i>Intentional Insufficiency of Preliminary Inquiries.</i></p>

<p>Never was there the least justification for reprisals.
Read the Reports of the Commission of Inquiry,
and the narratives of ocular witnesses, and you will
find that the most horrible things are continually
done without any pains being taken to verify the
facts. Soldiers greedy for pillage say, without
justification, <i xml:lang="de">Die Civilisten haben geschossen</i>; and
that is enough. The order is given to kill the
men and reduce the neighbourhood to ashes. Or
shots have really been fired on the Germans;
the civilians are suddenly accused, and without
listening to the unhappy prisoners, who offer to
prove that the shots were fired by Belgian or
Allied soldiers, the Germans proceed to execution.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<p>A very typical case is that of Charleroi. We
knew that French troops were still occupying the
town when the Germans entered. But these last
immediately accused the civilians, since, they said,
shots were fired from the interior of the houses,
as though their adversaries had not the right,
quite as much as they, to take cover in the buildings.
Moreover, when they later were confronted
with the proof that the French were there, they
merely remarked that the latter's mission was to
organize and to discipline the civic guards and
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> (<i>see</i> Heymel's article, p. 196).
Could one imagine a finer example of preconceived
opinion?</p>

<p>M. Waxwieler insists emphatically on the unspeakable
frivolity with which the Germans carry
out "reprisals." He cites notably the case of
Linsmeau (p. 256) and that of Francorchamps
(p. 270). As this is an essential point, I may
perhaps be permitted to relate a few more cases.</p>

<p>On entering Wépion on the 23rd August the
Germans pretended that the citizens had fired on
them, and they shot, then and there, six of them,
among whom were the two younger Bouchats.
Now those who had fired were Belgian soldiers
armed with machine-guns, who were covering the
retreat of the Belgian troops. A moment's reflection
would have enabled the Germans to realize
their error, since civilians obviously had no
machine-guns at their disposal. While they were
being led to their death, one of the Bouchats begged
a glass of water of their mother. But the Germans
refused to allow it to be given him: "It's not worth
the trouble now," they said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<p>In August 1914 a French patrol and a German
patrol came into collision at Sibret (Belgian Luxembourg)
and exchanged shots; they then retired,
leaving a wounded German on the ground. Two
inhabitants of Sibret carried the wounded man
toward an ambulance; the clerk to the <i xml:lang="fr">Justice de
Paix</i> of Bouillon, M. Rozier, accompanied them.
He was carrying the rifle slung over his shoulder
and the soldier's knapsack in his hand. A German
patrol came up and questioned M. Rozier, telling
him, no doubt, to raise his hands or throw down his
rifle. As neither M. Rozier nor any of his companions
understood German, and were unable to
comply with the order, the Germans fired on
M. Rozier, killing him.</p>

<p>Every time it has been possible to obtain any kind
of inquiry from the Germans it has resulted in their
confusion; at Huy the bullets found in the bodies
of Germans were German bullets; the General was
forced to stop the burning of the village; he even
admitted that a mistake had been made.</p>

<p>An example of another kind, also taken from the
<i>N.R.C.</i>, is equally characteristic. During the night
a German soldier fired a rifle-shot, no one knew why,
in a village of Western Flanders. Great alarm immediately.
"The village is going to be burned!"
But before they had time to get to work an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
piece of evidence, the empty cartridge-case,
proved that it was really a German soldier who fired.
However, if by chance this blessed cartridge-case
had not come to hand the village would have
burned. Too often, alas! the German army does
not trouble to postpone the reprisals awhile ...
and the houses are in ashes before the falsity of
the accusations has been proved. It is to be
remarked, indeed, that it is never the Germans
who prove the truth of their allegations, but the
Belgians who have to prove the Germans in error.
It is justice reversed.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand that a <i xml:lang="fr">non-lieu</i> does not
please the German authorities. In fact, their object
is not to render justice but to terrorize the population;
and if it were necessary to examine the <i>bona-fides</i>
of their accusations they would not be able
to exercise "reprisals," which would not suit them
at all!</p>

<p>If the accusations had really been justified by the
attacks of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" the Germans would have
taken care to establish their existence irrefutably.
For we must not forget that according to Article 3
of the Hague Convention they ought to indemnify
us for all the burnings and massacres commanded by
them.</p>


<p><i>A "Show" Inquiry.</i></p>

<p>They know, however, how contrary these summary
executions are to the spirit of justice, and
they sometimes attempt to lay a false trail. Read,
for example, the chapter devoted by Dr. Sven Hedin
to the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>." The great Swedish geographer,
of whose wonderful Asiatic journeys every
one has heard, made a tour along the Western front.
He therefore visited the occupied portion of France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and Belgium, and wrote an enthusiastic book on the
German Army, <i xml:lang="de">Ein Volk in Waffen</i>. In the course
of this work, he describes the manner in which an
inquiry is held into the circumstances of an attack
by "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>." Everything is done as regularly
as possible, and the affair ends in an acquittal.
Was the tribunal authentic, or was it merely a
parody?<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It matters little; the essential thing
for us is that it was desired to prove to Dr. Hedin
that the Germans are not barbarians, and that they
observe the forms of justice even while on campaign.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mentality of an Officer charged with the Repression
of "<span xml:lang="fr">Francs-tireurs</span>."</i></p>

<p>Let us now compare with the account of Dr.
Hedin that of a German officer entrusted with the
repression of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>." Captain Paul Oskar
Höcker gives a few curious details in his interesting
book, <i xml:lang="de">An der Spitze meiner Kompagnie</i>. He had to
clear of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" a portion of the territory
comprised between the German frontier and the
Meuse. His mission consisted in this: to present
himself at houses, to ask if there were arms, and
in case of a reply in the negative, to search the
house; if arms were discovered the householder was
shot on the spot; in case of resistance the house
was burned (p. 83). The first farm he visits is
Jungbush, near Moresnet; the inhabitants assure
him they have no arms. They are told that if they
are hiding one rifle they will be punished with
death; they repeat that they have none. And
now the soldiers bring up a boy of fifteen who
was hiding under the straw with a Belgian rifle
and five cartridges. He is shot without further
inquiry (p. 26). It is permissible to ask whether
it would not have been juster and more humane
to have looked into the matter a little more closely.
The remainder of the book instructs us as to the
psychology of Captain Höcker. At the house of
the vicar of Thimister, where he passed the first
night in Belgium, his bedroom door did not lock,
and this was enough to make him shake with fear
(p. 29). On the following morning he had a pigeon
shot, which he suspected of being a carrier of despatches
to "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"; "and in truth," he
says, "the pigeon bore a stamp on the left wing"
(p. 30). This proof is perhaps somewhat slender
in a country where all pigeons which take part in
matches have a mark of this kind. He confiscates
all the small-arms and parts of arms in the establishments
of the innumerable armourers of the district,
and smashes everything in their workshops.
On one such occasion he burns a house whose owner
does not consent with good grace to the destruction
of his plant (p. 30). On the same day he finds that
all the houses from which shots were fired have been
burned; in his satisfaction he does not even ask himself
whether those who fired were soldiers or civilians
(p. 31). Neither has he a word of reprobation for
the fury which the Germans display against Belgium:
Belgium, forced to take the side of the Allies
when her territory was violated by Germany. He
reaches Visé at the moment of its burning; he
accepts immediately the legend according to which
the bridge has been destroyed by "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
(p. 34). According to him, the Belgians of good
society do not become soldiers; he is convinced
that substitution is still in force with us, and that
for 1,600 francs (£64) one can escape from one's
military obligations (p. 39). To him, therefore, all
civilians appear cowards, and he is not surprised to
see them become "sneaking <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>." When
he passes through the streets of Louvain he listens
to the story that Germans have that very day been
fired upon (p. 47). Further on he admits without
hesitation that the German soldiers taken prisoners
before Liége must have expected to be shot by the
Belgians (p. 71).</p>

<p>We do not question the sincerity of Captain
Höcker. But why was so credulous and so suggestible
a person selected to search out and punish
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"? Assuredly because it was desired
that "reprisals" should be carried out without previous
discussion, and by some one whose conscience
should, nevertheless, be at rest.</p>


<p><i>Drunkenness in the German Army.</i></p>

<p>We have just seen that massacres very frequently
took place without any pretext having been brought
forward to excuse them. In nearly all cases alcoholism
was the cause of these, for the German
soldiers, and above all the officers, are scandalously
addicted to drink.</p>

<p>The first thing requisitioned by the officers is
always wine, by hundreds of bottles at a time.</p>

<p>Turn over a collection of German illustrated
papers: every time a meeting of officers is photographed
there are bottles and glasses on the table.
At the ambulance installed in the Palais de Justice
of Brussels the military surgeons have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
ashamed to steal the wine of the wounded men,
wine offered by the citizens of Brussels. The
general and his staff who installed themselves on
the 21st August, 1914, in the Palais Royal of
Laeken levied such vast contributions on the
cellars of the Palais that on the following morning
an officer was found, in the costume of Adam,
dead-drunk in front of a bath which he had not had
the strength to enter. When they left the Palais
they took with them many hampers of wine, and a
few days later they had a search made for further
hampers of the vintages which were their preference.
The cellars were soon empty.</p>

<p>They were drunken soldiers who provoked the
burning of Huy, the assassinations at Canne
(<i>N.R.C.</i>, 23rd August, 1914, morning edition), and in
part at least the massacres of Louvain. When they
occupied Gand the police had to collect them,
dead-drunk, on the very first morning; they had
already begun to fire revolver-shots.</p>

<p>It was after a tavern brawl between drunken
soldiers that the burning of a portion of Tongres
was decreed (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 22nd August, 1914, morning
edition). In Brussels, on the 28th September, 1914,
some drunken soldiers in a German cabaret situated
in the Rue de la Grande Ile, were firing rifle-shots to
amuse themselves; bullets lodged in the house-fronts
opposite. The officer whom some one went to fetch
that he might witness this misbehaviour believed
that an attack was being delivered by "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>,"
and, trembling like a leaf, refused to go
thither. The <i>N.R.C.</i>, 28th January, 1915 (morning
edition) states that a young girl of Eelen was
arrested as a "franc-tireur" because rifle-shots had
been fired by drunken soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us add that drunkenness might have had
harmless consequences if the authorities had not
exerted themselves to make the troops believe that
every unexpected shot is necessarily fired by a
"franc-tireur," and that so black a crime can only
be paid for by a general massacre accompanied by
the burning of the village concerned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is only one fashion of explaining the
horrors committed by the Germans: it is to admit
that they are modelled beforehand according to a
carefully devised system of intimidation: the systematic
inhumanity of their treatment of the enemy
population being intended to facilitate other military
operations.</p>


<p><i>Cruelties necessary according to German Theories.</i></p>

<p>Compare, for example, the laws of war according
to the German Great General Staff<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> with the stipulations
of the Hague Convention. As the last is
based on humanitarian considerations and seeks to
lighten the scourge of war for non-combatants, so
the Germans systematically refuse to make war less
cruel; on the contrary, they start with the principle
that the more terrible the war the more swiftly and
surely will its object be attained. Read the chapter,
"The Object of War," and you will be edified.
Even jurists like Baer, blinded by warlike passions,
dare to maintain that all must yield to military
necessities, including&mdash;what blasphemy!&mdash;the law
of nations. The characteristic theory that war
should be "absolute" and barbarous is the idea
underlying the manifesto of von Bissing which has
already been cited (p. 70). In fewer words Hindenburg
says the same thing<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> (p. 206). So that Belgium
might realize the fate that awaited her the German
authorities made haste to advertise their opinion.
It is true that they have since then posted up reassuring
phrases as to the humanitarian sentiments
of the German Army for the moment. Had our
butchers renounced their attempts at terrorization?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Terrorization: "Reprisals" as a "Preventive."</i></p>

<p>According to this hypothesis, that the great
"reprisals" undertaken at the outset of the war
would serve as examples, the Germans wished to
instil terror into the very marrow of our bones, so
that they might then be able to rule us with a small
garrison of Landsturm. Reflect, for example, that
Brussels, an agglomeration of 700,000 souls, has
never had a garrison of more than 5,000 men, and
has often had only 1,000.</p>

<p>Such a calculation is so abominable, so fundamentally
inhuman, that we shrank from the harshness
of this supposition, and accepted it with all
manner of reservations.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Well, our hesitation was
futile. In an article whose frankness is calculated
to make one's hair stand on end, Captain Walter
Blöm, adjutant to the Governor-General, published
in the officially-inspired <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> of the
10th February, 1915, the confirmation of that which
we hardly dared to imagine. Here are his exact
words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>"The principle according to which the whole
community must be punished for the fault of a
single individual is justified by the <i>theory of terrorization</i>.
The innocent must suffer with the guilty;
if the latter are unknown the innocent must even be
punished in their place; and note that the punishment
is applied not <i>because</i> a misdeed has been
committed, but <i>in order that</i> no more shall be committed.
To burn a neighbourhood, shoot hostages,
decimate a population which has taken up arms
against the army&mdash;all this is far less a reprisal than
the sounding of a <i>note of warning</i> for the territory
not yet occupied. Do not doubt it: it was as a
note of warning that Battice, Herve, Louvain, and
Dinant were burned. The burnings and bloodshed
of the opening of the war showed the great cities of
Belgium how perilous it was for them to attack the
small garrisons which we were able to leave there.
No one will believe that Brussels, where we are
to-day as though in our own home, would have
allowed us to do as we liked if the inhabitants had
not trembled before our vengeance, and if they did
not continue to tremble. War is not a social
diversion."</p>

<p>Any commentary would weaken the force of these
declarations.</p>


<p><i>Incendiary Material.</i></p>

<p>We are not in the confidence of the German Staff,
and we can only form hypotheses as to its mentality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
But here are two facts, easy to verify and interpret,
which show that the atrocities were committed with
premeditation.</p>

<p>Firstly, the existence of various incendiary
materials. When a town is condemned to be
burned the execution of the command is confided to a
special company of the engineers. (The <i xml:lang="fr">carnet</i> of an
officer of an "incendiary company" was picked up
in a commune of Hainaut.) Generally a first squad
breaks the windows and shutters; a second pours
naphtha into the houses by means of special pumps,
"incendiary pumps"; then comes the third squad,
which throws the "incendiary bombs." These last
are of many different kinds. Those most commonly
employed in Brabant and Hainaut include discs
of gelatinous nitro-cellulose, which jump in all
directions. Thanks to the inflammable vapours
which fill the houses, the latter catch fire on
all their floors simultaneously. It took only half
an hour to set fire to the Boulevard Audent at
Charleroi.</p>

<p>No one can suppose that so perfect an organization
was improvised during the campaign. Moreover,
where and how could the discs of fulminating
cotton have been procured?</p>

<p>At Termonde the Germans probably employed
cylinders of naphtha. At all events one can still
see, in houses which did not catch fire, holes made
in the ceilings and floors, into which holes long
strips of linen are introduced to serve as wicks.
The Germans sprinkled them with naphtha, and it
was enough to put a match to such a wick in order
to set fire to the joists of the floor overhead. At
Termonde 1,200 houses were burned in a single
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<p><i>The Two Great Periods of Massacre.</i></p>

<p>We discover, then, that the great destructive
operations were conducted according to a general
plan. Let us place in chronological order the most
important of the massacres and the conflagrations,
that is, those which could not have been carried out
except by order of the officers, omitting, therefore,
the killings in detail and the burning of farms and
isolated houses, attributable, no doubt, to soldiers
acting on their own initiative, or to small bands
greedy for pillage. What do we see? That apart
from the atrocities which marked the outset of the
campaign, the majority of the great killings and
burnings, in France as well as in Belgium, were
ordered during two periods: one from the 19th to
the 27th August, and one from the 2nd to the 12th
September, 1914. Now it is quite certain that in a
country already occupied, and deprived of means of
communication, the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" could not
possibly have agreed among themselves as to the
moment of their attacks. The only people who
could transmit an order were the Germans; and the
legitimate conclusion which one forms from this
lamentable list is that the pretended attacks of
<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span> were elaborated in Berlin, whence
they were ordered by telegraph to break out on a
given date.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact revealed by a chronological
list is that the so-called attacks of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"
very often do not coincide with the entrance
of the Germans into a given locality, but break out a
few days later. One might at a pinch understand
that poachers, or impulsive individuals, might fire a
rifle at a patrol; but it is wholly improbable that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
would make their attempt at a moment when they
were already impressed by the formidable warlike
equipment of our enemies. This is so contrary to
common sense that the Germans try to get out of it
by lying. Let us cite a case. They assert that on
Tuesday the 25th August, 1914, there was in Louvain
only a weak garrison of Landsturm, and that the civil
population profited by this circumstance to attempt
an attack, which could only be repressed by incendiarism
and massacre. Now the people of Louvain
had been warned that very morning that 10,000
men were to arrive during the day, and that many
houses which had not yet billeted soldiers would do
so the following night. And, indeed, that afternoon
several fresh regiments were seen to enter, notably
the 53rd, 72nd, and 7th Hussars.</p>

<p>When, by exception, the Germans assert that the
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" have attacked a column on the
march, one almost always remarks the three following
points: (1) the attack takes place while a village
is being traversed; (2) it happens when a great part
of the column has already passed, so that the
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" are caught between two fires;
(3) the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" are concealed in the houses.
A moment's reflection suffices to show that these are
precisely the most unfavourable circumstances which
civilians could choose for their attack.</p>


<p><i>Protective Inscriptions.</i></p>

<p>All this shows that we have not to deal with acts
of indiscipline, which are, God knows, the inevitable
accompaniment of any war, yet which are almost
excusable. We have here a maturely considered
system, prepared at the Great General Headquarters,
and then frigidly applied. In other words, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
"reprisals against <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" form part of the
plan of campaign of the German army. If additional
proof were needed that they are disciplined cruelties,
as the Minister of State, M. Emile Vandervelde,
remarks, it would be found in the inscriptions and
placards placed upon property which is to be
respected.</p>

<p>Besides the inscription which says simply that the
house must not be burned save with the authorization
of the <i xml:lang="de">Kommandantur</i> (at Louvain, after the great
fires of the 25th and 27th August, nearly all the
houses which were spared received one of these
placards), there are others giving the reasons for the
protection accorded to the building. Here are some
of these reasons: the inhabitants are respectable
(<i xml:lang="de">gute</i>) people; they have German sympathies; they
have already given the troops all they possessed;
they are protected by the Legation; an officer knows
them personally. The fact that with very few
exceptions these houses escaped disaster well demonstrates
the strength of German discipline. It is by
no means astonishing, therefore, that in the localities
which are still intact the inhabitants should have
taken precautions; thus, there have been houses in
Brussels which were provided with a protective inscription.
Other buildings have been marked on a
plan (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 14th September, 1914, evening
edition). This reminds one of the tenth plague of
Egypt and the sign which the Jews had to place
upon the lintel of their dwelling, that the Lord might
recognize it. When the Lord passed, He spared
the marked houses (Exodus xii. 7, 22). In the
German plague which has settled upon our poor
country, the Destroying Angel has the aspect of an
officer with a single eye-glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Accusations against the Belgian Government.</i></p>

<p>What makes the German accusations against the
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" particularly serious is, firstly, the
terrifying, infernal nature of the punishments which
follow these accusations; and secondly, the fact that
they involve our constituted authorities.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> "The
Belgian Government has openly<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> encouraged the
civil population to take part in this war," says one
whose word has weight in Germany, for he is none
other than the Emperor in person. And he did not
content himself with telegraphing this to America;
he spread this impudent assertion over the walls of
our cities (p. <a href="#Page_208">208</a>). Had he at least the excuse of
believing what he said? Most certainly not; for
years he had been informed by his spies of the details
of our military organization; he knew, then, perfectly,
what Belgium was or was not doing.</p>

<p>At the time the first accusations of this kind were
made the Belgian authorities had informed Germany
that, conformably with the laws of war, they were
fighting only with their regular troops (2nd <i>Grey
Book</i>, Nos. 68, 69, 71). And they posted everywhere
proclamations recommending the people to keep calm,
forbidding civilians to take part in the fighting, and
counselling the citizens to deliver their arms to the
communal administrations (2nd <i>Grey Book</i>, No. 71).
At the same time the principal daily papers repeated,
day by day, on the first page and in large type, the
text of these placards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>These appeals were heard, and our compatriots, if
they owned rifles, immediately took their arms to the
<i xml:lang="fr">maisons communales</i>. Would you believe it, this
measure of precaution was exploited against us! For
later, when the Germans occupied our <i xml:lang="fr">hôtels de ville</i>,
and discovered the presence of rifles, each ticketed
with its owner's name, they pretended to have
brought to light a proof of premeditation (<i>N.R.C.</i>,
4th September, 1914, evening edition): "Look!&mdash;say
the officers&mdash;with what care the Belgian authorities
have prepared for the guerilla war! Each citizen
has his rifle ready to hand at the <i xml:lang="fr">hôtel de ville</i>!"
The soldiers must indeed have been ridden by the
"fixed idea" of the "franc-tireur," or they must
have realized the poltroonery of such suggestions!</p>

<p>But the Germans made assertions much more
extravagant than this. In Belgium repairs to buildings
are effected with the assistance of scaffoldings
suspended against the outer walls; and at the time
of building the house openings are left immediately
under the cornice, in which the cross-beams supporting
the scaffolding are fixed when required. These
openings are closed outwardly by some sort of
decorative motive. Now, a German captain gives
a detailed description of these arrangements, and
arrives at the conclusion that these are <i>loopholes for
<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span></i>!</p>

<p>What a mentality for an officer! So fantastic an
explanation evidently will not bear a moment's reflection;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
but that matters nothing; it is none the
less reprinted by the work <i xml:lang="de">Die Wahrheit über den
Krieg</i>, to be served to the Germans remaining in the
country. The authors of the statement know that
their compatriots have lost the critical sense and that
they are ready to accept, their eyes closed, and their
minds also, anything that is told them.</p>

<p>This example shows that while inciting the soldiers
in order to bring them to the required pitch of
irritation, the rulers of Germany are equally concerned
to create a violent current of hatred in their
own country. It was necessary, in fact, since there
was nothing with which the Belgian nation could be
reproached, and since nevertheless they were making
war upon it, to invent a few serious motives of
animosity.</p>

<p>In a preceding chapter we examined the wretched
diplomatic accusations which the Germans have
forged in an attempt to compromise our political
circles. We shall presently deal with the abominable
accusations of cruelty brought against the Belgians.
Here we will content ourselves with citing yet one
more fact relating to the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>."</p>

<p>When the civil population of a locality was accused&mdash;or
convicted, as the butchers said&mdash;of having borne
arms against the German troops, the procedure was
generally as follows: The houses were fired, and the
inhabitants driven towards a public square, or into
the church. They were divided into two groups:
one of men, the others of women, children, and old
folk. Then a certain number of men were shot;
often, too, a few of the women, children, and old
people. After the execution, which took place in
the presence of the whole village, the women, children,
and old people were set free to wander amid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
smoking ruins. The officers used to make it their
duty to be present at these operations, as much to
encourage and, at need, to assist the executioners, as
to enjoy the spectacle. At Tamines they sat at table
in the open, drinking champagne, while the victims
were being buried. The Germans themselves realized
what disgust such behaviour excited; they tried to
deny the facts, but these were proved.</p>


<p><i>Treatment of Civil Prisoners.</i></p>

<p>What was done with the men not killed? They
were sent into Germany in order to show the
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" to the people. One can easily
imagine what the journey was like: in cattle-trucks,
where they remained packed together for several
days, without even having room to sit down; tortured
by hunger and thirst to the point of losing their
reason&mdash;which meant being shot there and then.
The stoppages in the railway stations, when the
population came to insult them, making gestures of
cutting their throats ... one can picture it all.
Then the life in camp, where they are even less well
treated than the soldiers, for at least these latter are
regarded as prisoners of war, and, in that quality, as
being protected, up to a certain point, by the Hague
Convention; while the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" are criminals
in common law, who are given, for food, scarcely
anything but soup made of beet, fish-heads, and
slaughter-house offal.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to obtain information as
to their sojourn in Germany from those who have
returned. Before leaving, it seems, they were forced
to make a promise to reveal nothing, under penalty
of being sent back to Germany. We know, however,
that certain of these prisoners, coming from an agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
district, were forced to go down the coal-pits
of Essen (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 10th October, 1914, evening
edition), while others were made to gather in the
harvest in Westphalia. When they refused to go to
work they were beaten with sticks; a young man on
the outskirts of Brussels still bears the marks of such
treatment.</p>

<p>This is a revival of the deeds of antiquity. The
ancients also reduced the able-bodied inhabitants to
slavery, employing them in agriculture or the mines.
It only remains for the Germans to sell us at auction,
as Julius Cæsar did in the case of the 53,000 Belgians
captured at Atuatuca (<i xml:lang="la">De Bello Gallico</i>, ii. 33).</p>

<p>They sent not only "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" into Germany.
They made prisoners also in localities where nothing
had happened. Thus they took all the inhabitants
of the non-active civic guard of Tervueren. The list
bore 135 names; as many of the men had left the
commune, the Germans completed the number by
taking the first civilians who came to hand; for they
had to have 135 prisoners from Tervueren to exhibit
in Germany.</p>

<p>On several occasions it happened, during the period
of the great massacres, from the 20th to the 27th
August, that bands of prisoners taken into Germany
were not accepted and were sent back to Belgium.
Such was the case with numerous prisoners from
Louvain, who were taken back to Brussels, then
taken to near Malines, and there left in the open
country; the same was done with several hundreds of
men, women, children, and old folk from Rotselaer,
Wesemael, and Gelrode. Here, in a few words, is
their Odyssey. To begin with, they were expelled
from their houses, that these might be burned, on
the 25th and 26th August. Then they were driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
by the troops as far as Louvain, and there crammed
by force into cattle-trucks, which in two days conveyed
them to Germany. There they were witnesses
of a violent dispute of which they were the object,
and finally, after they had been given a little food in
the railway station, they were put back into their
trucks. They reached Brussels on the 31st August,
where they were restored to liberty; that is, they
were told: "Get out of here, and be off with you."
And there were these unhappy folk, turned out of the
railway station, dejected, bewildered, their glances
vacant, almost dead with drowsiness and fatigue, the
men supporting the old people, the women carrying
the children. The people of Brussels who saw this
lamentable procession go by will never as long as
they live forget the impression of misery which they
received. Assistance was organized immediately,
and our poor compatriots were given shelter in the
various public establishments of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode.
They remained there several weeks before
daring to return "home."</p>

<p>How many civil prisoners were there in the various
camps of Germany: Celle, Gutersloh, Magdeburg,
Münster, Salzwedel, Cassel, Senne, Soltau, etc.?
The lists which have been published in <i xml:lang="fr">Le Bruxellois</i>
are very incomplete. On the other hand, persons
who were believed to be prisoners in Germany have
in reality been shot. Thus, in the little garden
facing the railway station of Louvain a trench was
opened on the 14th and 15th January, 1915, in which
were found a Belgian soldier of the 6th line regiment
and twenty-six civilians of Louvain, who were
believed for the most part to be in Germany; among
them were two women and the curé of Herent.</p>

<p>Many of the people of Tintigny, Rossignol, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
other localities, who had been taken away as civil
prisoners, were shot by the roadside. Those of
Musson escaped only because the order had come
from Germany not to kill any more prisoners: by
July 1915 they were not as yet repatriated.</p>


<p><i>The Return of Civil Prisoners.</i></p>

<p>In November and December there returned to
their "homes" (we mean to their native towns,
not to their houses, which were burned) about
450 inhabitants of Dinant, more than 400 of
Aerschot, and several hundred people of Louvain,
of the 1,200 which had been taken away.</p>

<p>Many of them bore, painted in white oil paint
on the back of their waistcoats the words: <i xml:lang="de">Kriegsgefangene-Münsterlager</i>.
Until March 1915 those
living at Dinant had to present themselves regularly
before the military authorities.</p>

<p>On the occasion of their return the communal
administration of Dinant was compelled publicly
to thank the Germans.</p>


<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">City of Dinant.</span></div>

<p>On the occasion of the return of a portion of our civil prisoners,
I believe it my duty to invite the whole population to observe
the most absolute calm. Any demonstration might be severely
repressed.</p>

<p>The return of a portion of our fellow-citizens, held in captivity
for nearly three months, constitutes an act of benevolence, an act
of generous humanity on the part of the military authorities, to
whom we offer the thanks of the administration and those of the
people of Dinant. By its tranquillity the latter will endeavour
to manifest its gratitude.</p>

<p>I also beg the returning prisoners immediately to resume their
labours. This measure is necessary, as much in the interest of
their families as in the interest of society.</p>

<div class="right">

<span class="smcap">E. Taziaux</span>,<br />

</div>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of January 1915 about 2,500 inhabitants
of Brabant were sent back in a body. They
had left the camps on Sunday, the 24th January,
and they reached Louvain on Friday the 29th,
and Brussels and Vilvorde on Saturday the 30th.
During this five days' journey they had not been
allowed to leave the trucks into which they were
crammed; for all nourishment they received some
black bread and water, and on occasion a turnip or
a beet. The Louvain prisoners had the greatest
trouble in the world to walk as far as the ruins
of their houses. Those from beyond Assche were
set down at the Gare du Nord in Brussels; they
had to be carried as far as the tram for Berchem;
their swollen feet refused all service. These unhappy
people were still wearing the light clothes
which they were wearing in August, when they were
dragged from their villages, and since then they
had never had a fire. Those from Tervueren were
taken from the trucks at Schaerbeek; they were
driven home in carts.</p>


<p><i>German Admission of the Innocence of the Civil
Prisoners.</i></p>

<p>What crime had these unhappy folk committed to
be treated in so terrible a fashion? None. The
Germans themselves admit it; none (2nd <i>Grey
Book</i>, No. 87). The German authorities communicated
the following note to the Belgian newspapers&mdash;we
copy it from the <i xml:lang="fr">Écho de la presse internationale</i>
of the 30th January, 1915:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief of the German Army has authorized
the return to Belgium of the Belgian civilian prisoners:
(1) against whom no inquiry of any military tribunal is in
progress; (2) who have not to undergo any penalty of any
kind. Consequently all the women (17) and 2,577 men will
be able to re-enter the country.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief of the German Army is
the Emperor. It was he, then, who recognized the
innocence of the civil prisoners.</p>

<p>No charge, therefore, could be brought against
them; these prisoners were recognized as being completely
innocent; the authorities admitted that it was
without any motive that they were kept five months in
Germany, without care, without fire, almost without
food, herded together like beasts, in perpetual fear
of being shot, knowing nothing of their families&mdash;for
they were unable for many weeks either to write or
receive news. Some of them succumbed under their
privations; others were shot; many have become
insane; all were so aged and enfeebled by ill-treatment,
methodically applied, that their neighbours
hesitated to recognize them. Will they ever recover
from such an experience?</p>

<p>No doubt the German authorities knew long ago
that the deportation of these civilians was a judicial
error; or rather that they were sent into Germany
to give the people there the occasion to torment and
insult the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span> captured alive." And yet
they were not repatriated until the moment when
the fear of famine forced Germany to organize the
seizure of foodstuffs and to ration her population.
It was not at all because of a spirit of justice that
the civil prisoners from Belgium were sent home
(and also part of those from France); it was only
a measure of economy; the authorities merely
wished to prevent their eating German bread,
which had become too precious; they preferred to
place them in the care of the American charities.</p>

<p>And when they were at last sent home, how were
they treated? Did the Germans at least show the
consideration which the slave-dealers used to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
for their black cargo? No; for the slave-dealers had
a pecuniary interest in preserving the market value
of their flock, while for German militarism the
Belgian civilians do not count: <i xml:lang="de">Es ist Krieg</i>.</p>


<h3>B.&mdash;The "Belgian Atrocities."</h3>


<p><i>The Pretended Cruelty of Belgian Civilians toward
the German Army.</i></p>

<p>In order to organize the massacres by means of
which it expected to terrorize our country, the Great
General Staff had to have at its disposal troops on
which it could count without reserve, which would
not shrink before the bloodiest task, and to which
no repressive measures would seem excessive. The
Staff had to be certain it would be obeyed without
hesitation when it ordered, as at Dinant, the death
of seven hundred men, women, and children. To
obtain soldiers who would undertake such barbarous
operations, and operations so contrary to the military
spirit, the obsession of the "franc-tireur" would
perhaps be insufficient; for there are soldiers even
among such troops who are brave and who do not
tremble at bogy-stories; there might be honest men
among them to whom theft would be repugnant by
whatever name one adorned it, and who would not
be tempted by the bait of pillage; all were not so
imbued with Kultur as that officer who proposed
not to kill the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" outright, but to
wound them mortally, afterwards to leave them to
die slowly, in agony, untended (p. <a href="#Page_342">342</a>).</p>

<p>But these soldiers, even the more gentle, would
regard it as a sacred duty to avenge crimes committed
against innocent persons. Let them be led
to believe that the Belgians have tortured peaceable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
tradesmen, or have mutilated wounded soldiers incapable
of defending themselves, or that they employ
dum-dum bullets, producing frightful wounds from
which recovery is almost impossible ... and immediately
these soldiers will have only one thought:
to make the first Belgian encountered expiate the
crime of which his fellow-countrymen have been
guilty. Before their thirst for vengeance all distinctions
disappear: children, old people, men and
women, all equally deserve to be punished. From
that moment it will be needless to order reprisals,
for the army will be only too ready to show itself
pitiless, and to call for an eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth, in order to make all the Belgians
indifferently pay for the offences committed upon
inoffensive Germans.</p>


<p><i>Some Accusations.</i></p>

<p>It is precisely this psychology which the rulers of
Germany have exploited. Immediately after the
opening of the campaign their newspapers began
to publish articles describing the horrors committed
by the Belgians; articles which make one's flesh
creep. Belgian women pour petrol over the wounded
and set fire to it; they throw out of the windows the
wounded confided to their care in the hospitals;
they pour boiling oil over the troops, and thereby
put two thousand out of action; they handle the
rifle and revolver as well as the men; they cut
the throats of soldiers and stone them; they cut off
their ears and gouge out their eyes; they offer them
cigarettes containing powder, whose explosion blinds
them. Even the little girls ten years of age indulge
in these horrors. The men are no better; to begin
with, they are all "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>," even when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
assume the appearance of respectable schoolmasters;
besides which they crawl under motor-cars to kill the
chauffeurs; they kill peaceable drinkers with a stab in
the belly; they foully shoot an officer who is reading
them a proclamation; they saw off the legs of
soldiers; they finish off the wounded on the field
of battle; they cut off their fingers to steal their
rings; they fill letters with narcotics in order to
poison those who open them; they set traps for
soldiers in order to torture them at leisure; even
the humanitarian symbol of the Red Cross does
not stay their homicidal hands; they fire on
doctors, on ambulance men, on motor-cars removing
the wounded.</p>

<p>That the soldiers leaving for Belgium were made
to believe that their adversaries were horrible barbarians,
and that the troops were inspired with an
ardent desire to avenge the innocent victims of the
Belgians, is amply proved by all the tales dating
from the beginning of the war. See, for instance, in
the story of <i xml:lang="fr">La journée de Charleroi</i> (p. 195) the impatience
with which the author awaits the moment
of entering Belgium to take part in the reprisals, and
his delight when he at last sees houses burned to
ashes and a curé hung from a tree.</p>

<p>Let us note in passing that the Austrians also,
desirous of declaring war upon us, resorted to
the invention of "Belgian atrocities." In its reply
to the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war, our
Government protested against this defamation
(1st <i>Grey Book</i>, Nos. 77, 78).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All these stories appeared, in the first place, in the
newspapers. We must not be surprised if in time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
war, when men's minds are over-excited, the journalists
willingly publish articles containing statements
of the kind we have cited, without troubling to verify
their authenticity. But it is unpardonable that they
should have been reprinted in cold blood, when their
falsity had become so obvious that it must have
struck even the most prejudiced. We know of two
pamphlets devoted entirely to atrocities committed
by the Belgians: <i xml:lang="de">Die Belgischen Greueltaten</i> and
<i xml:lang="de">Belgische Kriegsgreuel</i>. The work already cited, <i xml:lang="de">Die
Wahrheit über den Krieg</i>, also deals at length with
these atrocities. Finally, there is no lack of information
concerning them in the pamphlets <i xml:lang="de">Lüttich</i>
and <i xml:lang="de">Die Eroberung Belgiëns</i>.</p>

<p>One remark occurs to us immediately. The
narratives are based on details given by witnesses
"worthy of credence." Now all verification is
impossible, for we are never given a hint as to the
date; moreover, the locality is very rarely mentioned;
in <i xml:lang="de">Die Wahrheit</i> there are only three place-names:
Gemmenich, Tavigny, and Demenis.</p>

<p>Demenis does not exist, and we have in vain
sought to discover what locality is meant. And
what did really happen in the other two communes
mentioned? At Tavigny the Germans never had
occasion to commit any reprisals; not a man was
killed, not a house burned; the troops merely proceeded
systematically to loot the place. Nor did
anything more happen in any neighbouring commune
which the narrator might have confused with
Tavigny. Nor was there any confusion of names
with Tintigny; in the latter village the Germans
behaved in the most atrocious fashion, but the mode
of operation was quite different. As for Gemmenich,
we have no information as to what passed there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
But we can assert that not a single house was
burned there. Now it is very certain that if the
Belgians had committed the atrocities of which
the Germans tell, the latter would have set fire to the
village; it is therefore highly probable that nothing
happened there. In short, of the only three place-names
given all three are incorrect.</p>

<p>We cannot be expected to refute all these
allegations. Many are utterly ridiculous: for
example, the story of the narcotics at the Liége
Post Office; that of the fingers cut off the dead
and wounded and then carefully preserved in a bag
(one may well ask why); that of the boiling oil is
no better: try to imagine the incredible store of
oil that must have been possessed by the women
who killed and wounded therewith 2,000 Germans;
moreover, either the German army does not march
down the middle of the street, or else the women
had special apparatus to throw jets of boiling liquid
to a distance without danger to themselves.</p>

<p>Let us confine ourselves to examining the legend
of the gouged-out eyes. It is that which crops up
most frequently under the pens of the German
publicists, so well calculated is it to arouse horror
and indignation in the readers. Well! its falsity
appears from an inquiry made by the Germans
themselves. Not only have their newspapers&mdash;notably
the <i xml:lang="de">Kölnische Volkszeitung</i> and <i xml:lang="de">Vorwärts</i>&mdash;on
several occasions done justice upon this lie, but an
official commission, instituted by the German
Government, has also admitted that there is not
<i>a single case</i> in which a wounded German soldier
has been intentionally blinded (see <i>Belgian Grey
Books</i>, Nos. 107, 108).</p>

<p>The Germans themselves admit that the accusation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
is unfounded. Has their Press for that reason ceased
to make use of it? We little know the Germans if
we imagine that it has. The entire Press continues
imperturbably to spread these abominable calumnies.
The <i xml:lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</i> of the 15th February
(four o'clock edition), referring to an article by
Étienne Girau, pastor of the Walloon community
of Amsterdam, once more declares that the Belgians
have ill-treated the German wounded. It is enough
to make one ask whether the Belgians have not
<i>morally</i> blinded all the "intellectuals" of Germany.</p>

<p>Another example. In February 1915&mdash;that is,
when no honest German could any longer believe
in the legend of the gouged-out eyes&mdash;<i xml:lang="de">Vorwärts</i>
protested against a little work by a Pastor Conrad,
of which 150,000 examples were printed and sold at
8 pfennigs per copy to school-children, in which the
Belgians were still accused of having blinded their
prisoners (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 12th February, morning edition).</p>

<p>The Berlin Government also acts as though it
was ignorant of the conclusions of its own commissions
of inquiry. Wishing to refuse General Leman,
a prisoner in Germany, the privilege of receiving a
visit from his daughter, it based its refusal on the
atrocities of which German soldiers have been the
victims in Belgium, and on the inhuman fashion
in which the Belgians have treated the wounded and
prisoners in their hands. The second accusation
is as ill-founded as the first. The German soldiers
taken prisoner by the Belgians were interned in
Bruges; they made no complaints, far from it
(pp. <a href="#Page_56">56</a>-<a href="#Page_58">8</a>); as for the wounded in our hospitals, here
are precise facts.</p>

<p>Let us quote, first of all, from the correspondence
published in the <i xml:lang="nl">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
giving a few details from letters written by the
German wounded under treatment in Antwerp.</p>


<blockquote>

<p><i>How the Belgians treat their German Prisoners.</i></p>

<p>A private correspondent writes to us from Antwerp:&mdash;</p>

<p>The fact of knowing that the prisoners of war of the belligerent
States are treated as well as possible should also touch the hearts
of the Dutch.... I give you here some extracts from the letters
of wounded Germans under treatment in the hospitals of
Antwerp.</p>

<p>They treat us very well in Belgium. What the German

untrue. The Germans could not look after us better.
Moreover, the nation is highly developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the majority of these prisoners
fell into the hands of the Belgians at Aerschot, where the
Germans had imprisoned several hundreds of civilians in the
church, at the time of the investment of the town. I can speak
from experience. The German prisoners are treated with fully
as much kindness in other parts of the country. At the house of
the commandant of the <i xml:lang="fr">service de garde</i> in Bruges I saw an
assortment of German books and card games which had been
sent by Mme. E. Vandervelde, who had visited the prisoners
a few days earlier in the company of her husband, Minister of
State and the Socialist leader of Belgium. The latter wished
to make sure that the prisoners lacked for nothing.</p>

<p>We can say that Belgium does not seek to avenge her
unheard-of sufferings by maltreating the German victims of the
war. Suffering evokes pity in a sane mind. I can only express
the hope that these proofs may fall into the hands of German
readers.</p>

<p>But we have something better than these documents
of a private nature. The German authorities
exhibited, at Spa, a statement that the German
wounded there were perfectly well cared for. At
the moment when the Germans dispensed with the
collaboration of the clinical staff of the Red Cross
in Brussels, they did homage to its devotion and
competence.</p>

<p>It is useful to observe that these declarations have
been made spontaneously, since it is obvious that we
were powerless to exert any pressure on the Germans.
They have, therefore, nothing in common with those
which the Germans have forced the Belgian wounded
or prisoners to sign.</p>


<p><i>The Pretended Massacres of German Civilians.</i></p>

<p>There remain the famous massacres of Germans
in Brussels, Antwerp, Liége, etc. According to
witnesses "worthy of credence," inoffensive Germans,
even women and children, were killed and martyred
in various Belgian cities. At Liége alone more than
150 persons, of whom three-fourths were women and
children, were said to have lost their lives.</p>

<p>As to Liége, we have inquired of inhabitants of
the city, several of whom are closely connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the administration of justice; no one had any knowledge
of any such occurrences. They have therefore
been invented, lock, stock, and barrel, by the "witnesses
worthy of credence," and we defy the Germans
to mention the name of a single one of these 150
"victims."</p>

<p>At Antwerp we can oppose, to the testimony of
those who were "present" on the occasion of
murders and serious assaults upon German women,
the official report, which admits that shops were
broken into by the populace, but which at the same
time attests that no German was wounded. Let us
add that the German Weber was <i>not</i> assassinated,
but is quietly living in Antwerp.</p>

<p>Let us proceed to the doings in Brussels; and let
us quote, from <i xml:lang="de">Greueltaten</i>, the most serious occurrences
there mentioned. We have a story, based on
hearsay, which tells, of course, of gouged-out eyes,
as well as three reports of ocular witnesses. The
first is that of a witness "worthy of credence" who
saw a child thrown from a window and a woman
dragged by the hair until she was insensible; he
also witnessed the murder of a German druggist,
one Frankenberg, who was betrayed by his own wife,
a Belgian. The second witness is the correspondent
of the Wolff Agency. He saw only what the people
of Brussels themselves witnessed: that is, that the
populace pillaged the German shops and cafés on
the 4th and 5th August. But he had not been
able to discover any acts of violence against the
person; those he mentions, in a couple of words,
without insisting on them, had been related to him;
but he does not even add that the witnesses were
"worthy of credence."</p>

<p>Finally we have a priest, who complains that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was arrested as a spy and beaten by the gendarmes.
Perhaps he was a spy; in any case, not a few
German spies disguised as priests have been discovered
in Belgium.</p>

<p>If we confine ourselves to the really serious occurrences,
to the cases in which Germans have been
killed by the populace, we find that as against some
155 anonymous cases, which cannot be verified,
there are only two in which names are mentioned.
These names are Weber and Frankenberg. Now
these two cases are apocryphal. Herr Weber has
quietly reopened his hotel in Antwerp; Herr Frankenberg
continues to breathe the air at Anderlecht,
a suburb of Brussels. Compare with these two cases
the three names of places mentioned in <i xml:lang="de">Die Wahrheit</i>
(p. 101).</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><i>Preventive and Repressive Measures taken by the
Belgian Authorities.</i></p>

<p>The truth is that in the various cities of Belgium
there was, quite at the beginning of hostilities, an
intense popular effervescence, by which evildoers
profited to pillage the German shops. These disturbances
were so unexpected and assumed, with
such rapidity, such large proportions, that the police
were at first powerless to restrain them.</p>

<p>Moreover, it must be remembered that the police
had just been reduced, a large proportion of the
police agents and gendarmes having left for the
front.</p>

<p>But measures were promptly taken, and by the
7th August there was no longer anywhere the least
disorder of this kind. As for the "spy mania," it
raged in Belgium as in all countries affected by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
war.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But the newspapers, and the official measures
taken, got the better of this fresh cause of disturbance.</p>

<p>The newspapers of the neutral countries, for
example the <i xml:lang="nl">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant</i>, also
reported material damage, but they do not relate
more serious occurrences in any part of Belgium.</p>

<p>We can consequently assert, in the most categorical
fashion, basing our statement on the official
data furnished by the courts, that no serious offence
against the person has been proved either in Brussels
or elsewhere. Does this mean that we excuse the
fishers in troubled waters who sacked the German
shops? Obviously not; but it must be owned that
there are bad elements in all agglomerations, and
that the populace of Berlin behaved no better than
that of Brussels: witness the remarks of the British
Ambassador in Berlin, and the excuses put forward
by the German authorities when his windows were
broken as the result of an article in the <i xml:lang="de">Berliner
Tageblatt</i>. Here we immediately perceive a contrast
of mentalities: the German newspapers incite their
readers against foreigners, while ours, on the contrary,
do their utmost to calm popular manifestations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>A detail which we regard as symptomatic, and
particularly revolting, in the German publications, is
the fact that in these cases, as in the matter of the
"francs-tireurs," our enemies seek to involve the
legal administration of our country. Now, not only
did our authorities immediately intervene to repress
the disturbances and to provide a military guard for
the <i xml:lang="de">Deutsche Bank</i> and the <i xml:lang="de">Deutscher Verein</i> in
Brussels, but they did more than their strict duty
in protecting German families, and enabling them
to return to their own country. Nothing is more
characteristic in this respect than that which happened
in Brussels on the nights of the 8th, 9th
and 10th of August, at the time of the Germans'
departure from the city. The latter assembled
at night in a building belonging to the city; in
the trams which took them thither every one hastened
to render them every imaginable service; at
the place of assembly the Civic Guards prepared hot
drinks for them; then, during the short journey to
the Gare du Nord, the same Civic Guards helped
them to carry their children and their luggage. Mr.
Brand Whitlock, United States Minister in Brussels,
who was looking after the interests of Germany, was
present in that quality at the departure of the
German families, and he expressed his gratitude to
the Belgians in a letter made public at the time.</p>


<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The United States Minister does Honour to the
Heroism and the Kindness of the Belgians.</span></div>

<p>The German Minister, before leaving Brussels, requested the
United States Minister, Mr. Brand Whitlock, kindly to take
over the interests of Germany in Belgium.</p>

<p>The United States Minister consented to protect the archives
of the German Legation.</p>

<p>It was in this capacity that Mr. Brand Whitlock was the
witness, two days ago, of the goodness of the people of Brussels,
who, with Mme. Carton de Wiart, the wife of the Minister of
Justice, and our brave Chasseurs of the mounted Civic Guard
at their head, provided hot drinks and refreshments for the four
thousand Germans leaving Belgium who were assembled at the
Royal Circus.</p>

<p>The spectacle profoundly affected the eminent diplomatist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Thanking the Belgian Government, His Excellency, Mr. Brand
Whitlock, writes to the Minister of Justice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Belgians display a heroism in dying on the field of battle
which is equalled by their humanity to non-combatants."</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="fr">Le Soir</i>, 11th August, 1914.)<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>In Germany the United States Ambassador, Mr.
Gerard, had also occasion to intervene; but there it
was to protect the British Ambassador from the fury
of the populace.</p>

<p>These examples will suffice, we think, to show
that the Belgians were as thoughtful in their
behaviour towards their non-combatant adversaries
as the Germans were violent and brutal. And what
was the result of our courtesy? Our enemies picked
a groundless quarrel with us in order to inflame the
minds of their soldiers against us.</p>


<h3>C.&mdash;Violations of the Hague Convention.</h3>

<p>Nothing would be easier than to show that our
enemies have not respected a single one of the
articles of the Hague Convention. But it is not
our intention to draw up this inventory. We prefer
to confine ourselves to a few facts which no one can
dream of contesting, so patent are they and so well
known to every one in Belgium. And we shall refer
only to those which will enable us to compare the
two mentalities: that of the German, crafty and
tyrannical, and that of the Belgian population,
refusing to bow the head to military despotism.
We exclude from our list those data which have
already been recorded in other publications: Belgian
<i>Grey Books</i>, <i>Reports of the Commission of Inquiry</i>,
<i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique et L'Allemagne</i>, etc. Lastly, we shall
deal only with what has happened in Belgium itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
so that we shall speak neither of prisoners of war
nor of the wounded.</p>

<p>These eliminations lead us to omit the whole of
Section I: <i>The Belligerents</i>. The three first articles
apply to "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>," Articles 4 to 21 relate to
prisoners, the wounded, etc.</p>


<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 22.</span></div>

<p><i>Belligerents have not an unlimited choice of means of injuring
the enemy.</i></p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 23.</span></div>

<p><i>Besides the prohibitions established by special conventions, it is
notably forbidden</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>To employ poison or poisoned weapons;</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>To kill or wound by treachery individuals belonging to
the hostile nation or army;</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>To kill or wound an enemy who, having laid down his
arms, or no longer having means of defence, has surrendered at
discretion;</i></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>To declare that no quarter will be given;</i></p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>To employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to
cause unnecessary suffering;</i></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>To make improper use of a flag of truce, of the national
flag, or of the military insignia or uniform of the enemy, as
well as of the distinctive signs of the Geneva Convention;</i></p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) <i>To destroy or seize enemy property, unless such destruction
or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of
war;</i></p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) <i>To declare abolished, suspended, or inadmissible the
right of the subjects of the hostile party to institute legal proceedings.</i></p>

<p><i>A belligerent is likewise forbidden to compel the subjects of
the hostile party to take part in the operations of war directed
against their own country, even if they were in the service of
the belligerent before the commencement of the war.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The violations of this Article are numerous. The
Germans themselves cannot deny that the employment
of toxic gases, such as those which were used
in the attack upon Ypres on the 22nd April, falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
under the condemnation of paragraph (<i>a</i>). We shall
recur to this matter further on. Let us remark for
the moment that we are not speaking of gas released
by the bursting of shells, but of clouds of gas intentionally
produced.</p>

<p>As to paragraph (<i>e</i>), the <i>7th Report</i> speaks in a
precise manner of the employment of dum-dum
bullets. After the German occupation we shall be
able to mention other irrefutable cases, of which it
would now be too dangerous to speak.</p>

<p>The prescriptions of paragraph (<i>f</i>) have often been
violated. At the fort of Boncelles, on the 7th August,
and at Landelies, near Charleroi, on the 22nd, our
enemies abused the white flag. At Ougrée and at
Grez-Doiceau they wore Belgian uniforms to deceive
their enemies. This action was repeated during the
siege of Antwerp; but this time the Belgians were
warned of the German mimicry, so that the "asses
clad in lions' skins" were nearly all left on the
battle-field.</p>

<p>We shall deal later on, when speaking of pillage,
with the infractions of paragraph (<i>g</i>).</p>


<p><i>Military Employment of Belgians by the Germans.</i></p>

<p>The last paragraph of Article 23 forbids belligerents
to compel their adversaries to take part in operations
of war directed against their own country. Let us
see how the Germans respect this principle where
civilians are concerned. At Liége (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 23rd
August, evening), at Vilvorde (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 27th August,
morning), at Anderlecht (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 28th August, evening),
at Dilbeek (N.R.C., 31st August, evening), at
Eppeghem (<i>see</i> photograph in <i>1914 Illustré</i>, No. 5),
at Soignies, and at Neder-Over-Heembeek, the
inhabitants were compelled to dig trenches for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Germans. A Dutchman (an extreme Germanophile,
however), saw peasants from the outskirts of Spa
compelled to perform the same task.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Spa</span>, <i>15th August, 1914</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>... The man, who had to return home (it was about noon),
accompanied us, and, while conversing, he pointed to the road to
Creppe, parallel to that which we were following, and at some
ten minutes' distance from the latter. They were working hard
at entrenchments there, about a quarter of an hour from the city.
There were some 150 Belgian workmen there, excavating the soil
under the threat of the rifles of German soldiers placed behind
them.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i>N.R.C.</i>, 22nd August, 1914, evening edition.)<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>At Bagimont, on the 24th August, 1914, the
inhabitants were forced to prepare the ground for
the landing of German aeroplanes. The same
villagers were forced to build huts for their
enemies.</p>

<p>We have the names (at the disposal of a commission
of inquiry) of twenty-nine inhabitants of a
village of Brabant, who were forced, with horses and
carts, to follow the German troops for several weeks,
transporting munitions and baggage. The Germans
had the right to requisition horses and vehicles, but
not to compel our countrymen to accompany their
teams.</p>

<p>Let us remark, while dealing with these violations
of Article 23 of the Hague Convention, that Germany
signed this Convention. But on her part this was
merely a comedy, for it is a rule with her rulers that
they cease to follow its prescriptions as soon as they
are in opposition to the <i>Usages of War</i>, according to
the Great General Staff. Now among the duties
which the occupier may impose on the inhabitants&mdash;according
to Germany&mdash;is the supply of transport
and the digging of trenches. In other words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Germany, though she readily approved of the Hague
Conference, makes war according to her own principles,
which are far less humane; but she none the
less demands that her adversaries should observe the
rules of the Convention.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><i>Measures of Coercion taken by the Germans.</i></p>

<p>On several occasions our enemies have sought to
force the Belgian population to manufacture explosives
and munitions for them. But the Belgians
have always refused, even when their resistance
inevitably condemned them to starvation. The
workers of the explosives factory of Caulille, in the
north of Limburg, resumed their tasks only under
the most terrible threats (<i>K.Z.</i>, 21st December,
morning edition).</p>

<p>The case of Caulille, announced to its readers by
a German newspaper, shows the cynicism with
which our enemies violate the Hague Convention,
which is in part their own work.</p>

<p>The same effrontery appears in the placard of
the 19th November, 1914; this threatens severe
penalties against Belgians who dissuade their compatriots
from working for Germany. One could
understand that the Germans might punish those
who used force or threats to prevent any one from
working for them; but to punish those who
"attempt" to act by simple persuasion!</p>

<p>This was a mere timid beginning. On the 19th
June, 1915, our enemies posted about Gand a placard
stating that severe measures were about to be applied
to factories which, "relying on the Hague Convention,
had refused to work for the German
Army."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The Communal Administration of Gand has
supplied us with the following notice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Notice.</span></div>

<p>By order of His Excellency the Inspector de l'Étape,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> I call the
attention of the commune to the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The attitude of certain factories which, under pretext of
patriotism and relying on the Hague Convention, have refused
to work for the German Army, proves that there are, in the
midst of the population, tendencies whose object is to place
difficulties in the way of the administration of the German
Army.</p>

<p>"In this connection I make it known that I shall repress, by
all the means at my disposal, such behaviour, which can only
disturb the good understanding hitherto existing between the
administration of the German Army and the population.</p>

<p>"In the first place I hold the Communal authorities responsible
for the spread of such tendencies, and I call attention to the
fact that the population will itself be responsible if the liberties
hitherto accorded in the most ample measure are withdrawn and
replaced by the restrictive measures necessitated by its own
fault."</p></blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Here, then, they declare that they are on the point
of intentionally violating the Hague Convention.</p>

<p>Certain articles which appeared in <i xml:lang="nl">Het Volk</i>, a
Christian-Democratic journal of Gand, on the 15th,
17th, 19th, and 22nd June, 1915, tell us what these
measures are.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<p>The workers of the Bekaert factory at Sweveghem
having refused to make barbed wire for the Germans,
the latter began by arresting three notables, of whom
two were promptly released. Then, to force the
men to resume work, they decided that the commune
should be placed under a ban; it was forbidden
to ride a bicycle or to use a wheeled vehicle, and the
introduction of foodstuffs was prohibited. The men
still persisted in refusing to make the barbed wire on
which their sons and brothers were to be caught in
the battles of the Yser. Sixty-one men were sent to
prison. The rest hastened to leave the village.
What did the Germans do then? They seized the
wives of the fugitives, shut them up in two great
waggons, and took them to Courtrai; at the same
time they posted up the names of those who had
fled, and enjoined them to return. Before the threat
of seeing their wives remain in prison until their
children perished in their empty homes, the workers,
with death in their hearts, had to resume their
fratricidal task. Truly <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i> is a fine thing!</p>

<p>In Brabant they went a different way to work.
They had requested M. Cousin to make barbed wire
for them in his factory at Ruysbroeck (in the south
of Brussels). He refused. They offered to buy his
factory. He refused. They requisitioned his works.
He was forced to submit. They installed themselves
in the factory and tried to begin making barbed
wire. But the machinery was worked by electricity,
and the electricity was provided by a central station
situated in Oisquercq. Naturally the Oisquercq works
refused to supply current. The Germans arrested
M. Lucien Beckers, the managing director of the
company, and kept him several weeks in prison.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><i>Living Shields.</i></p>

<p>It remains to examine a final violation of Article
23; a violation so revolting that neither those present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
at the Hague Conference nor the Germans themselves
in their <i xml:lang="de">Kriegsbrauch</i> had been willing to
consider it. We are referring to the use of "living
shields" (<i>7th Report</i>).</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><i>A German Admission.</i></p>

<p><i>Belgians placed before the Troops at Charleroi.</i></p>

<p>Our enemies are aware of the abomination of
which they are guilty in placing, in front of their
troops, Belgians intended to serve as a shield.
They are eager to deny such acts. Unfortunately
for them one of their own officers has described
a case of the kind (p. <a href="#Page_196">196</a>). His first care on
reaching the suburbs of Charleroi was to capture
civilians in order to force them to walk in front of
and among the cavalry. He waxes indignant over
the lamentations uttered by the wives of these
unfortunates. "If nothing happens to us," he told
them, "nothing will happen to the civilians either."
Could one more cynically express the idea that the
Germans made use of these hostages in order to
prevent their adversaries from firing on their troops?
At the first volley fired by the French, who were
posted behind a barricade, some of the hostages
were killed. The Germans promptly replaced them
by others, notably by priests.</p>

<p>At Nimy and Mons, the same method was
employed. The burgomaster of Mons, M. Lescart,
was himself placed before the German troops.</p>

<p>At Tirlemont, on the 18th August, 1914, during
their march on Louvain, they seized upon certain
"notables," including the burgomaster, M. Donny,
and pushed them before them in order to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
shelter from the Belgian bullets. They did not
release them until the following day, at Cumptich.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><i>Belgians placed before the Troops at Lebbeke,
Tirlemont, Mons.</i></p>

<p>More significant still was their conduct at Lebbeke,
near Termonde, on the 4th September, 1914.
Scarcely had they entered the village, in the early
morning, when they seized as many civilians as
possible&mdash;about 300&mdash;and forced them to march
before them. On passing through St. Gilles-lez-Termonde
they requisitioned more men to serve as
"living shields." When the Belgians attacked the
German troops ten civilians were killed; many
were wounded (<i>9th</i> and <i>10th Reports</i>).</p>

<p>The same evening the survivors were sent into
Germany as "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>."</p>


<p><i>Belgian Women placed before the Troops at
Anseremme.</i></p>

<p>At Anseremme it was behind women that the
Germans took refuge. They had committed the
blunder of sending all the men to Germany, as civil
prisoners, on the 23rd and 24th August, so that
only the women were left. They placed these in a
line along the river-wall on the bank of the Meuse,
and prudently hidden behind their skirts they rested
their rifles on the women's shoulders in order to fire
at the French on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>The French ceased fire as soon as they saw that
they were firing on women. At night the Germans
herded the unhappy women, with their children, in a
field; but on the following morning they brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
them out again to serve as a protective screen along
the river.</p>

<p>Such is German heroism! As we at present
understand the real sense of the words <i xml:lang="de">Den Heldentod
Gestorben</i> (died a hero's death), which the
Germans inscribe on the tombs of their soldiers,
they mean that these soldiers were unable to avoid
the bullets, although they heroically hid themselves
behind Belgian women.</p>

<p>As far as we know one must go back to Cambyses,
in the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, to find another example of
the "living shield." At the time of his expedition
into Egypt this prince, who was, the historians tell us,
famed for his cruelty, conceived the idea of placing
cats, which animals were worshipped by the Egyptians,
in front of his troops. Thanks to his stratagem
he prevented the Egyptians from attacking his
soldiers. Neither Attila, nor Ghenghis Khan, nor
Tamerlane made use of this method; it was left for
the Germans of the twentieth century once more to
put it into practice, with the increased ferocity
suggested by <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>.</p>


<p><i>Belgians forcibly detained at Ostend and
Middelkerke.</i></p>

<p>There are other circumstances also under which
the Germans have made a rampart of the Belgians.
From the middle of October 1914 they occupied
that portion of the Belgian coast comprised between
Lombartzyde and the Zeeland frontier. From time
to time the British ships and aeroplanes bombarded
the coast; they would undoubtedly have continued
to do so if the Germans had not taken pains forcibly
to retain numbers of Belgians in these localities.
According to the <i xml:lang="nl">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the 1st November they forbade the people of Middelkerke
and Ostend to leave those towns. Obviously
the British were as far as possible sparing Ostend
and Middelkerke, and directing their fire by preference
on the road joining these two places, and on that
running from Middelkerke to Westende. The
Germans were perfectly aware of this, and had precisely
for this reason forbidden any Belgian to leave
Ostend or Middelkerke. An officer at the <i xml:lang="de">Kommandantur</i>,
from whom our informant tried to obtain
some favour for a couple of Belgians, replied as
follows: "If we allowed the population to leave these
places the English would hasten to bombard the two
towns, and we should be the sufferers" (<i>N.R.C.</i>,
1st November, 1914).</p>

<p>However, at the end of December they expelled
all the men from Middelkerke, with the exception
of four. But the means of transport placed at
the disposal of the expelled inhabitants were insufficient
to enable them to take their families
with them, so that they had to leave many of
their wives and children behind. Every time the
British drop shells on the coast the Germans
hasten to post up the news in Brussels, adding
that the bombardment has resulted in fatalities
among the Belgians.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>They therefore fully appreciate the advantage to
be derived from retaining on the coast a population
which serves as a living buckler.</p>


<p><i>Belgians imprisoned in the Lofts of the Ministries.</i></p>

<p>At Brussels they behaved in a similar fashion in
order to prevent the Allied aviators from bombarding
the premises which they occupy in the Ministries.
Inhabitants of Brussels are sent to the <i xml:lang="de">Kommandantur</i>
on the most impossible pretexts. They first
remain for several days shut up in the lofts of the
Ministries. Then, after trial&mdash;and, obviously, sentence&mdash;they
are again confined in the lofts until
there is room for them in the ordinary prisons.
Every one in Brussels knows this, and of course the
Allied aviators are aware of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 25.</span></div>

<p><i>The attack or bombardment, by any means whatever, of undefended
towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings is forbidden.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><i>Bombardment of Open Towns.</i></p>

<p>Many violations of this Article have been discovered
by the Commission of Inquiry (<i>7th Report</i>).
Here again clearly appears the contradiction between
the fashion in which the Germans make war and that
which they require of their enemies. When their
dirigibles drop bombs on open, undefended districts&mdash;as
they did on the night of the 26th September, at
Deynze, when they wounded an old man in the hospital
of the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paule&mdash;their newspapers
related this prowess exultingly (<i xml:lang="de">Düsseldorfer
Tageblatt</i>, 29th September; <i xml:lang="de">Düsseldorfer Zeitung</i>,
29th September, 1914). They may do such things,
but no one else. When the Allied aviators bombarded
Freibourg in Brisgau on the 10th December,
1914, the Germans denounced them amid universal
indignation. One can only agree with the writer in
the <i>Times</i> who said: "If we want to know what
conduct we should observe in this war it is useless to
consult the laws; we must simply ask the Germans
if our conduct is agreeable to them or not."</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 26.</span></div>

<p><i>The officer in command of an attacking force must do all in his
power to warn the authorities before commencing a bombardment,
except in case of assault.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>General von Beseler followed the prescription of
this Article during the siege of Antwerp; he announced
on the 8th October that the bombardment
of the city would commence at midnight (<i>K.Z.</i>,
9th October, first morning edition). Everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
else the Germans have thrown their shells without
previous warning. This was notably so in the attack
upon Antwerp by a dirigible on the night of
24th August; the bombs found twenty victims. It
is true that Herr Bernstorff has declared that previous
advice is not necessary. In this he is in
agreement with the laws of warfare according to the
Germans.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 27.</span></div>

<p><i>In sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to
spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to public worship, art,
science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and
places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they
are not being used at the time for military purposes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Not content with setting fire to our monuments,
as they did at Louvain, Dinant, Termonde, and a
host of villages, the Germans never hesitate to bombard
those they cannot otherwise reach.</p>

<p>The most characteristic example is that of the
Cathedral of Reims.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> On Tuesday, the 22nd September,
we learned of the bombardment from a
placard. The telegram, dated Monday, the 21st,
asserted that the monument would as far as possible
be spared. That was enough; we knew then that it
was destroyed. And sure enough, the French newspapers
smuggled through to us on the following day&mdash;Wednesday&mdash;stated
that the cathedral had been
burning since Saturday, the 19th.</p>

<p>Little by little the information received grew
more precise. The French certified that they
had not placed any military post of observation
on the towers; neither were there batteries near
the cathedral. Moreover, they declared that the
cathedral should have been doubly respected, since
an ambulance had found asylum there&mdash;which, be
it said in passing, is denounced as an infamy
by the German newspapers (<i>K.Z.</i>, 4th January,
morning edition; <i xml:lang="de">Niederrheinische Volkszeitung</i>, 4th
January).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<p>The Wolff Agency reported the bombardment of
Reims Cathedral as quite a natural thing, a commonplace
operation. But before the indignation of the
entire civilized world (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 22nd September,
1914, evening edition) the Germans were forced to
display a hypocritical regret and to justify their
aggression.</p>

<p>Then official telegrams were posted up the same
day; two reflected German opinion, the third professed
to express the opinion of a Frenchman who
had favoured the <i>Times</i> with his confidences (placard
dated 23rd September, 1914).<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The conclusion,
naturally, was that the Germans had nothing to
reproach themselves with: their conscience was
clear as on the first day; they bombarded the
Cathedral of Reims because they were forced to
do so, despite their admiration for this marvel of
Gothic architecture ... but the presence of a
military observation-post on the towers had left
them no alternative.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, a fresh bombardment (placard
dated 15th October). Then, after two weeks' quiet,
they once more began to throw shells on what still
remained standing (placard of 30th October). On
the following day they announced that they had
protested to the Roman Curia. A few days later
they applied themselves to the destruction of the
Cathedral of Soissons, but once again because the
French forced them to do so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>What respect for the Hague Convention! How
touching the solicitude displayed toward monuments
of art and religion! Only in the very last
extremity do the Germans resolve to smash them
to bits; still protesting, of course, against the
violence done to their æsthetic feelings! Still
more touching is their sincerity. On the 10th
November they announce that the Vicar-General
of Reims has admitted that the towers have been
used for military operations, and that the Chancellor
has communicated this avowal to the Vatican
(<i xml:lang="fr">Le Réveil</i>, 11th November, 1914); on the 17th
they are forced to note the Vicar-General's denial,
but they maintain their accusations.</p>

<p>To estimate at their true value the German
declarations concerning Reims Cathedral, it is
enough to compare one of the three placards of
the 23rd September with the "official communiqué"
which they forced upon <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>. Here
are these two documents:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">News published by the German General Government.</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <i>23rd September</i> (official telegram, yesterday evening).&mdash;In
spite of these facts we have been able to verify the presence
on the tower of a post of observation, which explains the
excellent effect of the fire of the enemy's infantry opposing
our infantry....</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">The German Military Government.</span><br />
</div>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Military Operations in France.</span><br />
(<i>Official Communiqué.</i>)</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Antwerp</span>, <i>27th September</i> (communicated by the French
Legation).&mdash;The French Minister has received from M. Delcassé
the following telegrams....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>II. The German Government having officially declared to
various Governments that the bombardment of the Cathedral
of Reims was undertaken only because of the establishment of
a post of observation on the basilica, General Joffre asserts, in
a telegram communicated by the Ministry of War, that no French
observation-post was placed on this building.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The German Government did not invoke the presence of
an observation-post on the cathedral, but the presence of pieces
of artillery behind this church, so that it was impossible to reach
these guns without firing in the direction of the cathedral and
hitting the latter.</p>

<p>This was necessary to dislodge the French artillery.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, 29th September, 1914.)<br />
</div>
</blockquote>


<p>On the 23rd September they pretended that there
was an observation-post on the tower. On the 27th
they declared that they had never made any such
statement. German sincerity!</p>

<p>On the 7th July they placarded Brussels with
a document in which they made a display of their
artistic feeling. We asked ourselves what fresh
crime they were about to commit. Next day our
curiosity was satisfied; the newspapers informed us
that the German army had set fire to the cathedral

<p><i>Bombardment of the Cathedral at Malines.</i></p>

<p>Let us now consider how they behaved in Belgium.
The commander of the army besieging Antwerp three
times bombarded Malines without any strategical
excuse, for the town was absolutely empty of Belgian
troops. He had informed the Belgian authorities
that his troops would not fire upon monuments
so long as these latter were not serving any military
purpose (<i>N.R.C.</i> 13th September, 1914, evening
edition). Better still, he published, in the German
newspapers, a statement that he could not bombard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Malines for fear of touching the Cathedral of Saint-Rombaut,
but that the Belgians had not the same
scruples. What truth was there in the last assertion?
None, of course; if the Belgians dropped
shells on the outskirts of the town it was while
the German troops were there, a fact which our
enemies themselves recognized. For the rest, it is
easy to discover whether the damage done to the
cathedral was the work of Germans or Belgians.
The Belgians were to the north and west of the
town; the Germans to the south and east. Now
all the damage done to the cathedral is without
exception on the south and east faces. The reader
may draw his own conclusion. Here we have a
reappearance of the usual German system, which
consists in blaming others for their own misdeeds.
At Dinant, too, they pretended that the collegiate
church was destroyed not by them but by the
French.</p>


<p><i>The Pretended Observation-post on Notre-Dame of
Antwerp.</i></p>

<p>Of course they accused the Belgians of using
their belfries as observation-posts. The accusation
is false. We may cite Malines as an example
(<i>N.R.C.</i>, 25th November, evening edition), and
Courcelles (<i xml:lang="de">Die Wochenschau</i>, No. 46, 1914); but
the most typical case is that of Antwerp. They
reproduced in their illustrated journals (<i xml:lang="de">Die
Wochenschau</i>, No. 48, 1914; <i xml:lang="de">Kriegs-Kurier</i>, No. 7) a
photograph&mdash;or properly speaking, a drawing&mdash;published
by an American newspaper (New York
<i>Tribune</i>, 22nd October, 1914) representing a military
observation-post on the tower of Notre-Dame.</p>

<p>Even if we grant the picture a documentary value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
which it does not possess, it proves nothing, for
according to the American journalist (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 15th
November, evening edition), the military post existed
on the tower at a period when Antwerp was not
besieged, nor even in danger of being so; the city
had then to defend itself only against dirigibles,
which on two occasions paid it nocturnal visits,
with the accompaniment of bombs. It will be
understood that the <i xml:lang="de">Wochenschau</i> does not inform
us of this; it pretends that the soldiers were on
the tower to observe the German troops and their
heavy artillery during the siege.</p>


<p><i>German Observation-posts admitted by the Germans.</i></p>

<p>Let us now see whether our enemies have
abstained from employing monuments for military
operations. The <i xml:lang="de">Algemeen Handelsblad</i> (Amsterdam)
of the 3rd January states that machine-guns are
placed on the belfry of Bruges and on other towers
of the city. This fact is confirmed by M. Domela
Nieuwenhuys Nyegaard, a pastor of Gand, a convinced
Germanophile, who witnessed an attack by
British aviators, upon whom the machine-guns
installed on the tower of the Halles opened a violent
but ineffectual fire (<i xml:lang="nl">Uit mijn Oorlogsdagboek</i>, p. 319,
in <i xml:lang="nl">De Tijdspiegel</i>, 1st April, 1915).</p>

<p>Perhaps the Germans will contest this statement.
Here is another. Those who require of their adversaries
so scrupulous a respect for Article 27 of the
Hague Convention placed an observation-post on
the tower of St. Rombaut, during the siege of
Antwerp, in order to control their fire upon the
Waelhem fort. And this at least is indisputable,
for in their cynicism or lack of conscience (let them
choose whichever they please) they published a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
photograph of this infraction of the Hague Convention
in the <i xml:lang="de">Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung</i> (No. 44,
1914, p. 752).</p>

<p>This is not the only case admitted by them.
<i xml:lang="de">Zeit im Bild</i> (No. 43, 1914) reproduces on its cover
a photograph of a "military post on the tower of
an Hôtel de Ville." In this we see German soldiers
armed with rifles, watching an imaginary enemy.
This photograph was taken at the Palais de Justice
in Brussels, as is proved, without possibility of error,
by the church of La Chapelle, whose very characteristic
tower rises in the distance. The Germans
were so delighted with this violation of the Hague
Convention that they reproduced the photograph in
the illustrated supplement of the <i xml:lang="de">Hamburger Fremdensblatt</i>.
And what is most curious in this affair
is that they boasted of an offence which they knew
they had not committed. For, firstly, the soldiers
were not posted "on an Hôtel de Ville"; secondly,
they were not even posted <i>on</i> the Palais de Justice,
but to one side of it, as may easily be determined on
the spot; thirdly, German soldiers have never been
placed there to overlook an enemy!</p>

<p>Since mid-October of 1914 it is in Western Flanders
that the fighting has taken place. Did the
Germans eventually, before the universal reprobation
which greeted their exploits at Louvain, Reims, and
so forth, determine to respect the international
agreement to which they are parties? By no means.
They are far too contemptuous of conventions, as is
proved by the photographs of monuments bombarded
in the region of the Yser, which are published in
the illustrated newspapers, notably in <i>Panorama</i>, a
Dutch illustrated paper which surreptitiously enters
Belgium.</p>

of which Herr Stübben, one of the most eminent
architects of modern Germany, stated that its loss
would be irreparable. It escaped the shells, but not
the German soldiery, who destroyed it with the butts
of their rifles, after the capture of the town. Always

</blockquote>

<p>"Family honour and rights!" The cases of rape
prove the respect of the German army for these
prescriptions!</p>

<p>"Individual life!" By the end of September 1914
the Germans had killed more civilians than soldiers.
This simple statement says more than could a long
exposition.</p>

<p>"Private property!" Theft and pillage are phenomena
so commonplace that the inhabitants no
longer insist upon them; if they mention the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it is to say: "The Germans behaved well here; they
only took all we had." We shall therefore confine
ourselves to citing a few cases particularly typical of
the German mentality.</p>

<p>It is indisputable that the conflagrations started
under the pretext of chastising "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" were
in reality designed to conceal the pillage committed
by the German army. This was certainly the case at
Aerschot (<i>4th Report</i>) and at Louvain. The officers
who gave orders to start these fires were therefore
accomplices of the pillaging soldiery. For that
matter, how could they have disavowed the thefts
of their men, seeing that they themselves largely
took part in the scramble? Whole trains left
Brussels, Louvain, Malines, and Verviers for Germany,
loaded with "war booty for officers." During
their journey to Belgium, Herren Koester and Noske,
on the 23rd September, at Hubesthal, saw numerous
trains passing which were laden with war booty
(<i xml:lang="de">Kriegsfahrten</i>, p. 8); there were at that time no
serious battles either in France or in Belgium, so
that there was no capture of war booty in the
Western sense of the term.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The trains observed by
the Socialist authors could only have been carrying
the fruits of pillage; they came probably from
Malines, which the Germans at this time were
scrupulously emptying, as well as the numerous
châteaux of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Not a district has been visited by the Germans
that has not been totally despoiled. Of course, the
silver was taken first. One officer, after plundering
the entire store of silver of a villa at Francorchamps,
confided to a neighbour that he was going to have it
melted down in Germany, with the exception of one
spoon, which he would keep as a "souvenir." Is it
not typical and delightful, this German cult of the
"souvenir" as a veneer of sentimentality on a basis
of rapacity? According to the definition given by
the Kaiser, this officer displayed his civilization but
not his <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>Another "requisition" of plate. In the railway
station of Mons, towards the middle of February
1915, a merchant unloading a truck-load of merchandise
had his attention attracted by a coffin
which was being removed from a neighbouring van;
suddenly he heard a metallic clink: the bottom
of the coffin had given way, and an avalanche of
spoons, forks, napkin-rings, and other articles of
silver tumbled out!</p>

<p>Nothing is sacred to the Huns. They smash the
tabernacles, treasuries, and poor-boxes of the churches
as readily as the coffers of the People's Banks (<i xml:lang="fr">Maisons
du Peuple</i>). At Auvelois they seized upon
43,000 frs. in the Maison du Peuple, this being the
entire capital of the Socialist Young Guard, the
Freethinkers, the newspaper <i xml:lang="fr">En Avant</i>, the Miners'
Union (<i xml:lang="fr">syndicat</i>), and other mutual aid societies.</p>

<p>At Beyghem, near Grimberghen, before setting
fire to the church, they broke open the safe in the
sacristy. Being unable to perforate it, they demolished
the wall dividing the church from the
sacristy, in which it was imbedded, so that they
were able to attack it from behind.</p>

<p>In most of the churches which were burned in
the north of Brabant (p. <a href="#Page_73">73</a>) the strong-box and the
tabernacle were broken open. It was the same in
the province of Namur.</p>

<p>As soon as the approach of the Germans was
signalled, many people hastened to pack up their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
furniture and valuables, in order more readily to
transport them in case of evacuation. This foresight
almost always failed in its object, owing to
the impossibility of finding a horse and cart at the
moment of departure. These packing-cases and
hampers, all ready corded, presented an insurmountable
temptation; the officers were never able to
resist it, and the goods were sent straight to the
railway station.</p>

<p>We are informed that at the beginning of the
German occupation officers were frequently mistaken
as to the actual value of the articles which
they removed; so that they sent their families worthless
rubbish "made in Germany." To avoid these
unpleasant misconceptions, they made their inspections
in the company of experts who directed their
choice.</p>

<p>Need we add that the wine-cellars were always
methodically exploited? The bottles which could
not be drunk on the spot were packed for later
consumption, or to be sent to Germany. In a
château near Charleroi the officers had the doors&mdash;which
were beautiful examples of joinery&mdash;taken off
their hinges, and used to make packing-cases for the
bottles.</p>

<p>We must not forget that drunkenness has played
an important part in the atrocities committed by the
German army.</p>

<p>The Germans were not content with making a
clean sweep of the private houses and châteaux;
they also stripped the Governmental offices which
they occupied in Brussels of their furniture. In the
Ministry of Public Works a portion of the maps of
bridges, buildings, etc., was burned, and a portion
sent to Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Thefts of Stamps.</i></p>

<p>As to those who despoiled the Ministries, we will
give them the credit of supposing that they acted by
order and in the interest of their Government; but
we cannot thus excuse the conduct of one officer
who, having possessed himself, goodness knows how,
of a number of Belgian stamps, attempted, in a
stationer's shop, to pay for 80 frs.' worth of goods by
means of these stamps. Meeting with a refusal
from the shopkeeper, he had to content himself
with paying for only a portion of his purchases in
this manner. In a neighbouring watchmaker's
he did better, for he was able to get rid of 100
frs. in stamps; at a discount, of course.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He
informed the watchmaker that he possessed 4,000
frs.' worth of Belgian stamps. The latter was not
so indiscreet as to ask how he obtained them.</p>

<p>Better still: the Germans do not conceal the fact
that they are thieves. The <i xml:lang="fr">Matin</i> (Paris, 9th June,
1915) reproduced the photograph of an announcement
published by a Swiss newspaper.</p>

<p>"It informs us that a thief of the German army,
desiring to realize the 'war booty' which he collected
in Antwerp, offers for sale unused stamps
of values between 10 centimes and 10 frs. In
his 'stock' of booty are 19 different stamps of a
total value of 29 frs. 70 (oh, that 70 centimes of
pillage!) which he offers for 3 frs. 50.&mdash;All Germany&mdash;philosophical,
political, military, and commercial&mdash;is
contained in this little advertisement."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p>At Tamines, having burned about 250 houses,
on the 21st and 22nd August, 1914, and having
forced the living to bury the 416 unhappy people
shot on the evening of the 22nd, they sent all the
survivors to Velaines-sur-Sambre. There they were
given their liberty, and told that they might go
to Namur or to Düsseldorf, but not to Tamines.
Why not to Tamines? They understood a few
days later, when they were bold enough to return
despite the prohibition. The Germans had completely
emptied all the shops and all the private
houses in the place. It is evident that this operation
can be effected in a more methodical and comfortable
manner when there are no children running
between your legs, or women begging you to leave
them some souvenir for which they have a particular
affection.</p>

<p>At Louvain they acted in the same manner; they
proceeded to wholesale pillage only after the 27th,
when they had sent all the inhabitants away.</p>

<p>Sometimes the love of pillage got the better of
discipline. At Jumet, on the road from Brussels
to Charleroi, on the 22nd August, 1914, the troops
were ordered to burn all the houses, because the
French of the 110th Infantry had dared to attack
them with machine-guns. But some soldiers who
had entered a tobacconist's amused themselves by
stealing cigars and cigarettes, and were so absorbed
that they forgot to set fire to the shop, so that it
has remained intact in the midst of a long row of
burned-out buildings.</p>

<p>What disgusts us most in all this pillage is not
that the German troops should have marked our
unhappy country for pillage; it is the indisputable
complicity of the leaders of the army. Nothing
more clearly proves the benevolent intervention of
the military and civil authorities in the operations
of brigandage than the regular transport of "war
booty" into Germany. The officers make no secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of sending to their homes such things as pianos,
pictures, jewels, furniture, glass, etc. They do it
openly, with the obvious complicity of the railway
officials. The latter are entrusted with the organization
of the rapid transportation to the Fatherland
of mountains of cases, containing the results of the
methodical exploration of our houses and châteaux
and shops and warehouses. It is a vast organization
of brigandage, hierarchically regulated, in which
every one steals without hiding the fact from his
fellows. Who knows whether the coffin full of silver-plate
which burst in the Mons railway station did not
belong to some officer who had swindled his accomplices?
We in Belgium have witnessed the regular
working of a system of "co-operative brigandage
under the august protection of the authorities."</p>

<p>Let us note, finally, that theft and pillage are
expressly forbidden by the German <i>Usages of War</i>.
Articles 57, 58, 60, 61, and 62 prohibit all destruction
of private property. But we must suppose that
their <i>Usages of War</i> are applicable only in times of
peace, since from the very first days of the war
the German army began to pillage the regions
which it occupied. This spoliation has been pursued
with the systematic spirit which characterizes
<i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>.</p>


<p><i>Illegal Taxation.</i></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Two placards exhibited in Brussels on the evening
of the 12th December (Saturday) attracted general
attention.</p>

<p>They first convoked the Provincial Councils for
the 19th December, and imposed upon them, not
simply a general "order of the day," but an imperative
mandate to vote a war-tax. The second
gave details of this tax: 480,000,000 frs. was
to be paid in monthly instalments of 40,000,000
(£19,200,000 in twelve payments of £1,600,000)
(see <i xml:lang="de">Belg. Allem.</i>, p. 120).</p>

<p>Baron von Bissing thus advertised, seven days
in advance, the decisions to be taken by the Provincial
Councils. Doubtless he was made to understand
that the proceeding was a little extreme, and
contrary both to the law and to common sense; for
on the following morning the second placard was
covered with a blank sheet of paper. Better still,
the "Official Bulletin of Laws and Decrees for the
occupied Belgian Territory" gave in its issue of the
19th the text of the two decrees; but this number
was suppressed, and in its place another placard,
numbered 19, was distributed, which included only
the first decree.</p>

<p>On the 19th December our nine Provincial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Councils assembled. They could not do otherwise
than vote the crushing tax of 480 millions; but
several of them protested eloquently against the
illegality of this proceeding.</p>


<blockquote>

<p><i>Speech delivered by M. François André at the meeting of the
Provincial Council of Hainaut, on the 19th December, 1914,
in the presence of the German Governor and Dr. Daniest,
President.</i></p>

<p>... We have met by order of the German authorities to vote
a war-tax; to make one word of many, we have met to furnish
arms to the formidable invader of our country, to be used against
our heroic little Belgian army....</p>

<p>We are thus assembled to vote, <i>by order</i>, a war-tax.</p>

<p>I wish to protest&mdash;against both the form and the substance of
this tax.</p>

<p>As to the form, I regard this extraordinary session as absolutely
illegal; the Provincial Councillors are not qualified to vote war-taxes
affecting the whole country; moreover, the councillors of the
various provinces, in concerting as to the measures to be taken in
common, so to speak, which are matters beyond the scope of their
jurisdiction, are committing an offence in Belgian law, which law
no German decree has abrogated. As to the substance: Admitting
that the German authorities have the right to levy taxes on the
whole country, while our 120,000 soldiers are still in occupation
of our territory, it is very certain that according to the terms of
the Hague Convention no tax may be levied except for the needs
of the army of occupation.</p>

<p>What is an army of occupation?</p>

<p>It is that which, finding itself in a conquered territory,
undertakes the policing and safeguards the security of that
territory.</p>

<p>This is why it may appear legitimate for the army to force the
occupied territory to support it.</p>

<p>But our country&mdash;as Field-Marshal von der Goltz has declared,
and as is perfectly obvious&mdash;our country has become the basis of
military operations against the Allies. According to the spirit of
the Hague Convention, there is no army of occupation, properly
speaking, in our country, and in any case the 35,000 men concentrated
in Namur and the artillery assembled at Liége cannot
in any respects be regarded as making part of an army of occupation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, therefore, contrary to law and contrary to reason that
these 480,000,000 frs. are demanded from the country.</p>

<p>Are we then going to vote this formidable war-tax?</p>

<p>Assuredly if we listened only to our hearts we should reply:
No, no; 480,000,000 times no.</p>

<p>For our hearts would tell us:</p>

<p>We were a small nation, happy to live by its labour; we were
an honest little nation, having faith in treaties and believing in
honour; we were a confident little nation, and unarmed, when
suddenly, violently, Germany hurled two million men upon our
frontier, the greatest army that the world has ever seen, and she
told us: "Betray your given word; let our armies pass that I
may crush France, and I will give you gold." But Belgium
replied: "Keep your gold; I would rather die than live without
honour."</p>

<p>History will one day reveal the greatness of the action which
forever magnifies us in the eyes of the future. For nothing in
the annals of the past equals the sacrifice of this people, which,
having nothing to gain and all to lose, preferred to lose all in
order that honour should be saved, and deliberately cast herself
into an abyss of distress, but also of glory.</p>

<p>The German army thus invaded the country in violation of
solemn treaties.</p>

<p>"It is an injustice," said the Chancellor of the Empire; "the
destinies of the Empire forced us to commit it; but we shall
repair the wrong done to Belgium by the passage of our
armies...."</p>

<p>This, then, is how they mean to repair that wrong:</p>

<p>Germany will pay&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But no! Belgium will pay Germany 480,000,000 frs.! Vote
this money!</p></blockquote>

<p>As a matter of penal legislation, the Germans have
systematically ignored Article 48, as is proved by
the eloquent protest of the President of the Bar of
Brussels.</p>

<p>Yet another typical instance of the manner in
which Germany disregards our laws. At Aerschot
the Germans provisionally invested a German, Herr
Ronnewinkel, who had inhabited the district for
several years, with the functions of Burgomaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
On the 6th November, 1914, they proclaimed him
permanently burgomaster.</p>

<p>Here was a German appointed burgomaster by
the will of the district commander, although by the
terms of the law only a Belgian appointed by the
Government could be burgomaster. Moreover, they
did the same at Andenne. The communal autonomy
of which Belgium was so proud was thus trampled
underfoot.</p>

<p>We see, then, that in despite of Articles 43 and
48 of the Hague Convention and Article 67 of their
own <i>Usages of War</i> the Germans have shown no
respect whatever for the legislation in force. We
cite here only the most flagrant of these illegalities,
those which any person of common sense can understand
and judge.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 44.</span></div>

<p>This article was not accepted by Germany; she
remains faithful to her <i>Usages of War</i>: Article 53,
2nd, 3rd, and 4th paragraphs, and applies their
principles with extreme severity.</p>

<p>Nothing better illustrates the severity with
which the Germans act than the little manual
of conversation which terminates the <i xml:lang="de">Tornisterwörterbuch</i>,
published by the Mentor publishing house in
Schöneberg, Berlin. It is a small dictionary, costing
60 pfennigs, and intended, as the title indicates, to
be carried in the soldier's knapsack. The French
dictionary and the English are conceived according
to the same method; after information concerning
the country in question they give a summary of the
rules of grammar; then comes the dictionary properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
so-called, with phonetic pronunciation; finally, a few
common phrases, which to us are the most interesting
part of the book, since their choice naturally
reflects the requirements of those expected to employ
them. Here are a few passages from paragraph 4:
<i>Service of Outposts and Patrols</i>. In each passage
we copy all the phrases without exception, so as to
avoid misrepresenting the spirit of the work; and
this spirit, as will be seen, is ferocious. The volume
is not dated; but the 42nd edition, from which we
quote, describes (p. 44) the French campaigning
uniform of 1912. These phrases were therefore
printed at least five years after the second Hague
Conference (18th October, 1907). They show clearly
that the acts of cruelty committed by the patrols
against those who refused to betray their country
were not improvised by the cavalry taking part in
these reconnaissances, but were systematically premeditated.</p>

<p>A little manual of conversation costing 20 pfennigs&mdash;<i xml:lang="de">Deutsch-Französischer-Soldaten-Sprachführer</i>,
by
Captain S. Th. Hoasmann, is conceived on the same
lines. Here are a few examples. The soldier,
making a reconnaissance, declares: "Speak the
truth or you will be killed!" In the chapter on
"Posts and Telegraphs" we find the phrase: "It
is forbidden (on pain of death) to send telegrams."
And the sentinel should be able to say: "If you
lie you will be shot," etc.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 50.</span></div>

<p><i>No collective penalty, pecuniary or otherwise, shall be inflicted
upon the population on account of the acts of individuals for
which it cannot be regarded as collectively responsible.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This article proclaims the principle that in no case
must the innocent suffer with the guilty, nor in their
place. We have already seen that our enemies
oppose this idea; they maintain that the innocent
should suffer with the guilty, and even that if one
cannot lay hands on the guilty one may punish
the innocent in their place (p. <a href="#Page_84">84</a>). It was by
the application of this German principle of collective
punishment that Louvain, Dinant, Termonde, and
other towns were burned.</p>

<p>The placard of 1st October, 1914, clearly displays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the German mentality; it states that villages will be
punished without mercy, whether guilty or not.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Notice.</span></div>

<p>On the evening of the 25th September the railway and telegraph
lines were destroyed between Lovenjoul and Vestryck. In consequence
of which the two localities mentioned were, on the

supply hostages.</p>

<p>In future the localities nearest the spot at which such acts
have been committed&mdash;no matter whether they are guilty of
complicity or not&mdash;will be punished without pity. To this end
hostages have been taken from all localities adjacent to railway
lines threatened by such attacks, and at the first attempt to
destroy the railway lines, or telegraph or telephone wires, they
will immediately be shot.</p>

<p>Moreover, all troops charged with the protection of railways
have received orders to shoot any person approaching railway
lines or telephone or telegraph wires in a suspicious manner.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Fully to appreciate the horrible nature of this
placard we must recall the fact that during the siege
of Antwerp (which terminated only on the 9th)
Belgium patrols were penetrating into the midst of
the German troops, venturing thirty-five miles and
more from Antwerp, their mission being to harass
the enemy's communications and to destroy the
railways and the telegraph and telephone line. It
was one of these bodies of Belgian cyclists which
cut the railway and telegraph line between Louvain
and Tirlemont on 25th September, 1914. Von der
Goltz was evidently aware that this destruction was
a perfectly legitimate military operation, so that his
placard was intended simply to embarrass our military
authorities by showing them that in defiance of all
justice Germany intended to hold the Belgian civilians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
responsible for the activity of our army. In short,
instead of saying "no matter whether these localities
are guilty of complicity or not," von der Goltz would
have given a greater proof of sincerity had he said,
"although I know that these localities are in no way
guilty of complicity."</p>

<p>Here are two other placards, printed in Germany,
which show plainly that it is according to a system
that our oppressors hold the entire community responsible
for the act committed by a single person;
or rather, as we shall see, for the acts of the Belgian
army.</p>

<p>Very frequently the penalties with which the community
is threatened are not specified in these
placards. One may suppose that it would consist of
a fine; this is indeed the punishment most frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
applied, doubtless because it is the most
productive. Here are some examples, for cutting the
telegraph wires, various localities in Flanders were
forced to pay fines in December 1914.</p>

<p>The military chest does not lack for money; for in
a garrison command a fine may be inflicted more
readily than elsewhere. Here is an example. An
officer was choosing some music in a shop; and
found, amidst a heap of pieces of music, a copy of
the <i xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>. Now it has never been stated that
one must not possess the <i xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>. Result: the
shopkeeper was condemned to pay a fine of 500
marks or to twenty days' imprisonment. "I prefer
the imprisonment," said the unfortunate man.
"But, my good fellow, you can avoid going to
prison! Pay the fine!" "I know, but I have not
got 500 marks. I could only scrape together 150
frs. at most." "All right, give them to me!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><i>Fines for Telegraphic Interruptions.</i></p>

<p>The military chest is also replenished by the fines
paid because the telegraph and telephone do not
work properly. Now it has often happened during
the last six weeks that communication has been
obstructed in Flanders. The smallest communes
have been forced to pay fines.</p>

<p>Here is a brief list of such fines:</p>

<p><i>Fines for "Attacks by <span xml:lang="fr">Francs-tireurs</span>."</i></p>

<p>We may observe, in passing, that in September
1914 the accusation&mdash;the accusation, we say, not the
offence&mdash;of having allowed a telegraph wire to
deteriorate was punished, in Brussels, by a stoppage
of the telephone service; but in December the
Germans preferred to fill their treasury. The same
observation is true of Mons and Bilsen; the accusation
of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>," which in September 1914
would have ended in a massacre of the inhabitants
and the burning of the town, was in October the
motive for a tax of 100,000 frs. At that time it no
longer seemed essential to terrorize; the Germans
no longer required blood, but money.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">On behalf of the German Military Authorities.</span></div>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Warning.</span></div>

<p>The City of Mons has been forced to pay a tax of 100,000 frs.
because a private person fired upon a German soldier.</p>

<p>(<i>Posted at Louvain.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>And indeed it is money that is demanded everywhere&mdash;5,000
frs. from the commune of Grenbergen,
near Termonde, because an inhabitant
allowed his pigeons to fly. 5,000,000 frs. was
required of Brussels because a police agent maltreated
a German spy (p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>). It was with a money
fine that Mons was threatened should an Englishman
be discovered on its soil (placard posted at Mons,
6th November, 1914), and the city of Mons and the
province of Hainaut if any inhabitant retained for
his own use any benzine or a motor-bicycle (placard
posted at Mons, 6th October, 1914). At Seraing,
in February 1915, it was again money that was
demanded, because a bomb had burst within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
limits of the commune. The more surely to obtain
the sum, a few hostages were imprisoned, with the
promise that they would be sent to a fortress in
Germany if the communal treasury did not pay their
ransom; but the hostages themselves advised the
commune to refuse. The Germans, fearing to be
left in the lurch, reduced their demands by half;
finally, having obtained nothing, they released the
hostages. Singular justice, to regulate its penalties
not by the gravity of the offence, but according to
the temper of the victims! We are waiting for the
German newspapers to publish a schedule of penalties
as affected by the docility of the victims and the
season.</p>

<p>Here is an amusing instance of a penalty which
was inflicted upon Antwerp. When the Germans
posted up a statement that they had captured 52,000
Russians and 400 guns in Eastern Prussia, a playful
citizen replaced the first letter of <i>Russians</i> in the
Flemish text by an M and concealed the two first
letters of <i>canonen</i>. The new version announced
that the Germans had captured 52,000 sparrows and
400 nuns. The Germans were annoyed and imposed
a fine of 25,000 frs. on the city. At Tirlemont,
where the same pleasantry was perpetrated, the
Germans contented themselves with making vague
threats.</p>

<p>The adventure of Eppeghem also deserves to be
told in a few words.</p>

<p>In November 1914 a German soldier walking in
the country fired at a hare or a pigeon. An officer
turned up and questioned the soldier. As all sport
is reserved for officers, the soldier, to avoid punishment,
threw the blame on to the peasants. The
matter was referred to Brussels, and on the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
day officers arrived with forty Uhlans. A fine of
10,000 frs. was inflicted on the commune.</p>

<p>Some women living in a house which had by
chance remained standing, near the field in which
the soldier had fired, asserted that no inhabitant had
fired a shot, but that they had seen the soldier fire.
No one listened to them. "We must have 10,000
frs., and at once." But in this village, ruined
from end to end, where scarcely a house was habitable,
from which all the men had been deported into
Germany, there was no means of collecting such a
sum of money. "Since that is so, hostages will be
taken," said the officers. The Uhlans organized a
hunt, and seized the curé and three laymen, the only
ones they could find; and even of these one was
an inhabitant of Vilverde, who had obligingly been
acting as a citizen policeman at Eppeghem. They
were taken to Brussels, but on passing through
Vilverde the inhabitant of that place was released,
owing to the protests of his fellow-citizens. After
ten days' imprisonment Baron von der Goltz, finding
that there was nothing to be extracted from the communal
treasury of Eppeghem, and that the curé and
his two parishioners were being kept and fed at a
loss, set them at liberty.</p>


<p><i>Hostages</i></p>

<p>The taking of hostages is also in flagrant opposition
to the provisions of Article 50, but in conformity
with the German <i>Usages of War</i>. The hostage
guarantees with his own life that his fellow-citizens,
with whom he has no influence, shall faithfully
execute the orders of the German authorities.</p>

<p>The first care of enemy troops arriving in any
locality is always to demand the provision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
hostages; these are usually the curé, the burgomaster,
the notary, the schoolmaster, and a few
other notables. We may recall Liége, where the
bishop, Mgr. Rutten, was taken hostage; Spa,
Louvain, Charleroi, Gand, and Mons. In Brussels
they demanded the delivery of 100 hostages, but
afterwards withdrew the demand.</p>

<p>As to the fate which awaits the hostages if the
German army is attacked, it is plainly stipulated
in the proclamations: they will be shot, "without
previous judicial formalities." Thus, it would have
been enough for a Belgian patrol to renew its usual
activities near Forest, and two hostages would have
immediately been shot "without previous judicial
formalities."</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">General Government in Belgium.</span></div>

<p>Despite my repeated warnings attacks have again been made
during the last few days by the civil population of the neighbourhood
against German troops, and also upon the railway between
Brussels and Mons.</p>

<p>By the order of the Military Governor-General of Brussels
each locality must consequently provide hostages.</p>

<p>Thus at Forest the following are arrested:</p>

<p>
(1)  M. Vanderkindere, Communal Councillor.<br />
(2)  M. le curé François.<br />
</p>

<p>I proclaim that these hostages will immediately be shot without
previous judicial formalities if any attack occurs on the part of
the population upon our troops or the railway lines occupied by
us, and that moreover the most severe reprisals will be carried
out against the commune of Forest.</p>

<p>I request the population to keep calm and to refrain from all
violence; in this case it will not suffer the slightest harm.</p>

telegraph or telephone line, or other objects useful to
the operations of our army.</p>

such actions will be shot or hanged. The hostages of the
surrounding localities will suffer the same fate. I shall then

<p>We do not know if hostages were shot or hanged
in Belgium. But in the north of France, according
to a military correspondent of the <i>K.Z.</i>, at least one
hostage was killed; this assassination was the more
criminal in that it punished not a hostile act of the
inhabitants, but a perfectly normal and regular
operation of war: a bombardment.</p>

Beside it is a wholesale corn-chandler's and a wholesale wine-merchant's.
All this belonged to a single man. It was necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to shoot him as hostage, because the French were persisting,
despite all warnings, in throwing shells into the neighbourhood.
In the wine-cellars stores of unexpected importance were found;
according to the estimates there are more than half a million
litres of red and white wine of very good quality. A great part of
the wine was pumped out of the tanks and received, like an old
acquaintance, by the comrades far and near.</p>

who was more lucky, who in due time sought safety in flight.</p>

</div>
</blockquote>

<p>A very curious case of the punishment of innocent
people in the case of "guilty" ones is the following:
On the 7th October, 1914, the Germans posted
statements that the militia-men of the occupied
regions could not rejoin the Belgian army, and that
in case of disobedience the young men would expose
themselves to the risk of being sent into Germany as
prisoners of war. So far, nothing illegal. But the
placard then declared that in case of the departure of
any militia-man his family would be held responsible.
Now, how are the parents guilty, if their son intends
at all costs to fulfil his obligations to his native
country? On the 30th December, 1914, there was
an aggravation of this measure: the burgomasters
also were to be punished. On the 28th January, 1915,
a new notice appeared: all Belgians between the
ages of sixteen and forty years were to be regarded
as capable of military service. So when a man of
forty goes to join the Belgian army the members
of his family will be punished! Truly the notice
might have stated whether children would be punished
for not preventing their father's departure!</p>

<p>Have there been cases of repression? The <i>N.R.C.</i>
states that at Hasselt the Germans actually arrested
the fathers and mothers of the young men who
escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Tijd</i> learns from Ruremonde:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At Hasselt and in the neighbourhood the Germans have hunted
down the fathers of those young men who, liable to be called to
the colours, have been able, in spite of strict prohibition and
active supervision, to enter Holland, there to pass through
England and France with the intention of eventually joining
the army.</p>

<p>But as soon as they heard that the fathers were being arrested,
these latter also crossed the frontier, and the Germans found that
a great many birds had flown.</p>

<p>They did not stop then: the mothers were arrested in their
place.</p>

<p>At the same time the Germans made it known that all these
people would be transferred to the well-known camp at Münster,
and warned the women to provide themselves with as much
body-linen as possible. The whole of the little town was in
consternation. Later arrived a telegram from General von Bissing,
announcing that the departure for Münster was postponed for a
week, and the prisoners were taken to Tongres.</p>

<div class="right">

</blockquote>

<p>A last example of punishment inflicted upon the
innocent, when the "guilty" person had already
suffered punishment. A Belgian, having made
signals to the enemy (that is, to the Belgian army),
was killed while being arrested. Immediately the
curé and the vicar were sent to Germany as being
responsible for the members of their parish.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Important Notice.</span></div>

<p>Alidor Vandamme, inhabitant of Cortemarck, committed
espionage by making signals to the enemy. Resisting arrest,
he was killed by a rifle-bullet.</p>

<p>The German authority has taken the following measures of
coercion in consequence of the crime committed by Vandamme:</p>

<p>1.  The curé Blancke and the vicar Barra, responsible for the
members of their parish, will be deported as prisoners of war
to Germany.</p>

<p>2.  The commune of Cortemarck must pay a fine of five
thousand marks (5,000 M.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>This iniquity was not enough for the German
authorities: they advertised it all through Flanders

<i xml:lang="fr">Le Bien Public</i> to give it publicity. Through lack
of conscience or insolence?</p>

<p>The last paragraph of Article 23, already cited,
in reality presupposes that passage in Article 52
which forbids the occupant to force the inhabitants
to do work which would assist operations directed
against their country (p. <a href="#Page_112">112</a>).</p>

<p>Among the forms of contribution included in
Article 49 we must give first place to that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
fixes the value of the mark. The <i xml:lang="de">Düsseldorfer
Zeitung</i> of the 4th September announces that the
military commander of the occupied portion of
Belgium and France fixed the value of 100 marks
at 130 frs. And indeed placards posted at
Charleroi, Saint-Trond, Namur, and Liége required
the Belgians to accept German marks at this exaggerated
tariff, which has caused certain of our
merchants to lose considerable sums.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Proclamation.</span></div>

<p>The circulation of German money having given rise to
perplexities, <i>the value of the German mark has been fixed at
130 centimes</i>.</p>

<p>The attention of the public is called to the fact that all German
paper money must be accepted in financial transactions at the
same rate as German coin.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fraudulent intention in this measure was only
too evident. A month later Baron von der Goltz
made it known that until further notice the mark
was to be valued at the lowest at 1 fr. 25 (placard
of the 3rd October, 1914). In reality the mark was
worth only 1 fr. 08 to 1 fr. 15, so that the Belgians
naturally endeavoured to refuse German notes;
whereupon fresh placards were exhibited, compelling
their acceptance (placards of the 4th and 15th
November, 1914). We must mention an unhappy
phrase in a placard posted at Mons; it states that
the mark must be accepted <i>at the actual value of the
coin</i>, and further on fixes this value at 1 fr. 25,
which is obviously incorrect.</p>

<p><i>Contributions demanded from the Cities.</i></p>

<p>Let us now consider the pecuniary contributions
demanded from the cities. The most important
were: Liége, 20 million frs.; Namur, 32 millions;
Antwerp, 40 millions; Brussels, 45 millions. The
discussions excited by this last contribution are
extremely instructive; they have been reported by
the <i>N.R.C.</i> We learn how the Germans violated,
successively, all the different agreements which they
concluded with the city; finally they imposed a fine
of 5 millions, which enabled them, in spite of everything,
to complete the sum of 50 millions which
they had promised themselves they would extort
from the capital.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Contribution imposed upon Brussels.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">From one of our War Correspondents</span></div>

<p>... In the course of this journey I once more heard people
speaking of the reasons which resulted in the city of Brussels
being fined the sum of fifty millions of francs, as every one knows.
What I relate here I had from one of the most eminent members
of the magistracy:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the time of their entry here, the Germans demanded fifty
millions from the city, and&mdash;don't cry out at this&mdash;450 millions
from the province of Brabant. The communal council of Brussels
tried to demonstrate that the city could not pay this tax, and
that the tax imposed on the province was utterly exorbitant,
seeing that Brabant, which draws on the budget for an annual
sum of five to six millions, employed this money before it was
paid, and could not, therefore, pay a fine, since the province had
first to provide for its expenditure.... Having discussed the
matter at great length, the Germans finally released Brabant
from this war-tax, and at the same time gave the communal
council a week to find the fifty millions, during which period they
would suspend all other requisitions.</p>

<p>Burgomaster Max then had posted the well-known placard
announcing that for the coming week no requisitions whatever
would be made by the German authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>But on the following day the burgomaster was called upon to
justify his action, and although he produced the written convention
before the new Governor of the city, the latter gave him
to understand that his predecessor might possibly have granted
such a delay, but that he, being of superior rank, did not recognize
the clause at issue. Fresh negotiations were commenced,
and it was at last arranged that twenty millions should be paid
in five instalments of four millions each. Four of these instalments
were punctually paid, and the fifth was about to be paid,
when Max was summoned by the Governor, who asked him what
his arrangements were concerning the remaining thirty millions.</p>

<p>Max did not conceal his extreme surprise, stating that he fully
understood that the remainder of the tax had been remitted, and
that the twenty millions constituted the whole amount.</p>

<p>The German Governor was by no means of this opinion,
and demanded the remaining thirty millions. Thereupon Max
immediately sent an order to the bank to suspend payment of
the last four millions, which were ready for payment, until he
was certain that the Germans would accept them as the final
instalment. There was then on either side an equal degree of
obstinacy. The Governor maintained that Max was breaking
his engagements; Max, on the other hand, maintained that the
Germans had failed to keep their word. The result was that
the burgomaster was arrested, and he is at the present moment
imprisoned in a fortress at Glatz in Silesia.</p>

<p>The communal council was then warned that it would be
deprived of its functions, and that the Germans would take over
the administration of the city if the war-tax was not paid.</p>

<p>There were again interminable negotiations, and it was
arranged that in all forty-five millions should be paid.</p>

<p>The sum was paid. Still the Germans wanted to get hold of the
five remaining millions, so a police agent who had shown lack of
respect for an officer was condemned to five years' imprisonment,
while Brussels was fined five million francs.</p>

<p>One might ask whether, if the Germans continue to act in this
fashion, the city of Brussels will be forced to pay a fine each time
one of its functionaries is guilty of offence: for it is impossible
that the city can control all its employés.</p>

<p>In this case the German officer who was insulted was in
civilian clothes. Now to a complaint of the communal council
the Governor had replied, some time previously, that there were
no secret agents at work in civilian clothing; so that the police
agent could not have known that he was dealing with an officer,
since the latter was not in uniform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be imagined that lively protests were made, but once
more the Germans threatened to assume the direction of the
commune if the sum was not paid by the 10th November at
latest; so, although the council presented a memorandum on the
affair, it was nevertheless forced to pay in order to pursue its
mission in peace.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i>N.R.C.</i>, 9th November, 1914.)<br />
</div>
</blockquote>


<p><i>Exactions of a Non-commissioned Officer.</i></p>

<p>Fines without rhyme and reason, and exorbitant
war contributions have become so normal and so
customary that the Germans have finally learned to
exploit the situation. The <i>N.R.C.</i> for the 21st May,
1915, reported that the Council of War in Coblenz
had condemned to eighteen months' imprisonment
the non-commissioned officer Garternich, who had
demanded from several occupied Belgian communes
a war contribution of 3 frs. per head, and had thus
acquired, for his own personal profit, a sum of
27,393 frs. Does not this simple fact reveal
the habitual squeezing to which our poor country
is subjected? Eighteen months' imprisonment for
having emptied the communal treasuries already
officially despoiled by the authorities&mdash;that truly
is not much; especially when we compare this
sentence with those pronounced upon the communes
when a telegraph wire breaks down: the threat of
burning a whole neighbourhood or a formidable fine.</p>


<p><i>Requisitions of Raw Materials and Machinery.</i></p>

<p><i>Requisitions may only be demanded</i>, says Article
52, <i>for the needs of the army of occupation</i>. Now
our enemies have removed from Belgium enormous
quantities of raw material, and machinery which
evidently cannot be of use to the army of occupation
(see <i xml:lang="de">Belg. Allem.</i>, pp. 113, 116, 117). What can the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
army do with raw cotton, wools, spun cotton, nickel,
jute, etc.? It can be of use only to the industries
of Germany, paralysed by the suppression of the
mercantile marine. Among these requisitions are
included machine-tools for the manufacture of shells
(notably those removed from the national arsenal at
Herstal and the royal cannon foundry at Liége), and
metals, such as copper, which are indispensable to
the manufacture of munitions; so that the articles
which have been taken from us, contrary to
Article 52 of the Hague Convention, subscribed to
by Germany, are thus directly employed in fighting
against us.</p>

<p>The Germans cannot pretend that these requisitions
of machinery were made by over-zealous officers
ignorant of the laws, for Baron von Bissing himself,
in his quality of Governor-General, signed the
proclamation of the 17th February ordering the
despatch of our machine-tools to Germany. Moreover,
in Berlin even people are perfectly aware of
these requisitions, and of their destination (<i>N.R.C.</i>,
22nd February, 1915, morning edition).</p>

<p>We must insist on the fact that all these raw
materials of industry, all this machinery, etc., is not
bought, but requisitioned. There is here no case of
a commercial transaction, nor even an expropriation;
for we have no redress against the decision arrived
at in Berlin as to the prices which will be paid after
the war. It is a theft, to express the matter in a
word.</p>

<p><i>Requisitions in kind and in services ... shall be
in proportion to the resources of the country</i>, says
Article 52; which evidently means that requisitions
must not exhaust the country to the point of
jeopardizing the lives of the inhabitants. If this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
stipulation had been respected we should not have
to deplore the famine which is ravaging our country,
and to which we shall return later on.</p>

<p>We shall confine ourselves&mdash;in order to give some
idea of the excessive and inhuman manner in which
requisitions have been made&mdash;to referring the reader
to certain articles written by eye-witnesses, particularly
those who have seen what has happened near
the frontier, and at Gand. It will at once be recognized
that the requisitions made exceed that which
the inhabitants can reasonably provide (see <i>N.R.C.</i>,
10th January, 1915, morning; 23rd January, 1915,
morning; 16th January, 1915, evening; 30th
January, 1915, evening; 12th January, 1915,
morning; 22nd December, 1914, evening).</p>

<p>The Germans have always taken good care to
demand wine. They demanded enormous quantities
in the little villages of the Campine of Limburg
(<i>N.R.C.</i>, 15th January, 1915). Elsewhere they took
for their own use all the cellars of the wine-merchants
and the inhabitants, without allowing
the latter to make use of them (see <i xml:lang="de">Belg. Allem.</i>,
p. 118).</p>

<p>A last point as to requisitions. They shall <i>as far
as possible be paid for in ready money; if not, a
receipt shall be given</i>.</p>

<p>Very often no receipt has been given to the owners
of property taken. Elsewhere the receipts are
fantastical and valueless.</p>

<p>It is the truth that those who do receive vouchers
are requested to satisfy themselves of their accuracy,
but this prescription is obviously a dead letter.
Imagine, on the one hand, a peasant, Fleming or
Walloon, terrorized into a condition of helplessness,
and incapable of reading a voucher scrawled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
German; and on the other, soldiers whose customary
arguments are shooting and burning.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 53.</span></div>

<p><i>An army of occupation shall only take possession of cash, funds,
and realizable securities which are strictly the property of the
State, depôts of arms, means of transport, stores and supplies, and,
generally, all movable property belonging to the State which may
be used for military operations....</i></p></blockquote>

<p>From the very first days of the occupation the
Germans, in defiance of law and justice, seized upon
the communal treasuries and the funds deposited in
the branch establishments of the National Bank, the
post offices, etc. They were obliged to recognize
the justice of the protests made by the Belgian
Government; but their love of pillage is incorrigible;
on entering Gand, on Monday, the 12th October,
their first care was to lay hands on the 1,800,000
(£72,000) contained in the communal treasury.</p>

<p>According to Article 55 the Germans had no right
to remove the furniture of the Ministries of Brussels
(p. 134), since this property was not of a kind to
be useful in military operations.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 55.</span></div>

<p><i>The occupying State shall be regarded only as administrator and
usufructuary of public buildings, landed property, forests, and
agricultural undertakings belonging to the hostile State,
and situated in the occupied country. It must safeguard the
capital of such properties and administer them in accordance
with the rules of usufruct.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The German respect for legality did not restrain
them from violating this Article. From the very
first days of the war they employed the churches
which they consented to leave standing as stables;
on reaching Liége they took possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Palais de Justice and made a barracks of it. Why
did they expel Justice? Herren Koester and Noske
tell us (p. 30), it was simply because the position is
central and easy to defend (see a photograph facing
p. 32). They did not take account of the fact that
such employment of the building is doubly contrary
to the Hague Convention, since they did not respect
the nature of the monument, and exposed it to
bombardment by Allied aviators on the look-out
for the German garrison.</p>

<p>It was the same with the Palais de Justice of
Brussels, which also serves as a German barracks.
To adapt it to its novel use, the soldiers have
destroyed a great part of the magnificent furnishings
which adorned the halls; the immediate surroundings
have been fortified, and the cupola serves by
night as a station for signalling to dirigibles. In
short, all preparations have been made with a view
to the bombardment of Poelaert's masterpiece by
the Allies.</p>

<p>It is obviously with the idea of preventing their
adversaries from attacking them that they take
up their quarters in our monuments; these are
to serve them as artistic bucklers, just as our
compatriots are employed as living bucklers.</p>

<p>The violations of Article 55 are past counting.
We will confine ourselves to mentioning a few in
Brussels; they will give us some idea of the diversity
of the transformations which our property has suffered
at German hands. The offices of the Ministries are
transformed into bedrooms for officers. The Palais
des Académies has become a military hospital; God
knows in what condition we shall find its libraries.
In the Parc Royal of Brussels, in the centre of the
city, they have installed an automobile depôt, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
riding-track, and a rifle range; on the 28th October
a shot fired from this range wounded a lady through
the windows of the Schlobach <i xml:lang="fr">magasin</i> in the Rue
Royale.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 56.</span></div>

<p><i>The property of local authorities, as well as that of institutions
dedicated to public worship, charity, education, and to science and
art, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.</i></p>

<p><i>Any seizure or destruction of, or wilful damage to, institutions of
this character, historic monuments and works of science and art,
is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The first paragraph of this Article has been
scrupulously observed; the property of the communes,
etc., has indeed been treated as private
property has been treated: the latter has everywhere
been sacked and looted, and the Germans
have done the same to collective property.</p>

<p>As to the intentional character of these acts of
vandalism, it is indubitable. How otherwise explain
the fact that in numerous villages the church has
been the prey of the flames, in many cases even
when the surrounding houses have remained intact?
A few examples will suffice. The village of Haecht
was occupied on the 19th and 20th August. On the
24th the Belgians in Antwerp made a sortie which
was repulsed. The Germans, infuriated, shot 17
civilians and pillaged all the houses, particularly
remembering the wine in the cellars. Then
the inhabitants were expelled. A fresh sortie of
the Belgians took place from the 9th to the 13th
September; at noon on the last day our troops fell
back; in the afternoon the Germans set fire to the
church and 41 houses. The strong-box of the church
was broken open after the fire. The destruction of
the monument did not strike them as sufficient, and
they dynamited the whole on the 16th (or 17th)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
September. In the neighbouring village of Werchter,
after the battle of the 25th and 26th August, they
shot 6 civilians and burned 267 houses out of the 513
which formed the village. After the second fight,
on the 15th September, they burned the church.
In both villages most of the houses round the
churches were spared; it will therefore be difficult
for the Germans to pretend, as at Louvain, that the
burning of these churches was an accident (<i xml:lang="de">Brandunglück</i>)
due to burning fragments carried by
the wind (p. <a href="#Page_220">220</a>). We have already (p. <a href="#Page_73">73</a>) noted
another more significant case, that of the chapel of
the Béguinage of Termonde, which was alone burned,
in the centre of the Béguinage, not a dwelling of
which was touched.</p>


<p><i>Conclusions&mdash;The Famine in Belgium.</i></p>

<p>Germany had need, in the conflict with France, of
all the men who passed through Belgium; also she
could leave in Belgium only weak garrisons of the
Landsturm. To safeguard them against possible
attack on the part of the Belgian population, it
was necessary to terrorize the latter to such a
point that it no longer dared to stir. Such was
the object of the carnage and incendiarism which
marked the beginning of the campaign, as was
frankly admitted by Herr Walter Blöm, adjutant
to the Governor-General in Belgium (p. <a href="#Page_84">84</a>).
No doubt the massacres of Louvain, Andenne,
Tamines, and Dinant, committed to order between
the 19th and the 26th August, appeared insufficient,
for a new series was organized between the
4th and 13th September.</p>

<p>At the news of this butchery a resounding cry of
horror and indignation went up from all the nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of the earth. That the Belgian Army, on the field
of battle, should have paid large tribute to the war
unloosed upon us by Germany&mdash;that was to be expected,
but no one would have dared to suppose that
Germany, after participating in the second Hague
Conference, would display towards our civil population
such an implacable cruelty, such exterminating
fury, as history has never recorded since the Thirty
Years' War. But facts are facts; one must needs
submit to the evidence; the German Army has
destroyed our treasures of art and science, has
shot down in cold blood, often by machine-gun
fire, hosts of men, women, even old people and
children; it has ordered the burning of thousands
of houses; it has turned whole districts into deserts.</p>

<p>Still, some semblance of motive was necessary;
with a mathematical regularity the pretext of
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" was alleged. "<i xml:lang="de">Man hat geschossen</i>"&mdash;that
was enough; immediately the neighbourhood
was given over to massacre, pillage, and
fire. Never was any inquiry made, no matter how
summary. Yet when it was desired to show a
foreigner of note&mdash;for example, Dr. Sven Hedin&mdash;how
they proceeded in the matter of punishing
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>," a regular Council of War was
constituted ... which brought in a verdict of
<i xml:lang="fr">non-lieu</i> (p. <a href="#Page_78">78</a>). We defy the Germans to cite a
single case in which a tribunal of this kind has sat
<i>before</i> reprisals. In the few rare cases when witnesses,
etc., have been questioned the examination
has taken place <i>after</i> the firing of houses and the
shooting of inhabitants. This is why we declare
without the slightest reservation that <i>not one single
attack by civilians</i> has been established by any kind
of proof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>


<p><i>The Flight of the Belgians.</i></p>

<p>The inhabitants of our towns and our countryside
soon realized to what they were exposing themselves
if they awaited the arrival of the Germans in their
own homes. So, as the Germans advanced, a void
appeared before them. After the taking of Antwerp,
the majority of the peasants of the "Campine" of
Antwerp fled in all haste toward Holland. If to
them we add the people of Antwerp, who had been
driven out by the bombardment, and above all
the innumerable villages of Brabant, Limburg, and
the provinces of Liége and Antwerp, whose homes
had been pillaged and reduced to ashes, we shall not
be astonished to find that in October there were more
than a million Belgian refugees in Holland.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> To our
northern neighbours we owe our profoundest gratitude
for the fraternal manner in which they welcomed
our unfortunate compatriots.</p>


<p><i>The Causes of the Famine.</i></p>

<p>The horror provoked by the butchery at Dinant,
Aerschot, etc., relegated to the background the
purely material crimes. But these&mdash;the pillage,
methodically conducted, of our towns, villages,
farms, and châteaux&mdash;the outrageous requisitions
of provisions and of the raw material of industries&mdash;the
formidable taxes which drain us of coin&mdash;the
fines which rain upon the communal administrations
and on private persons&mdash;and many other infractions
of the Hague Convention&mdash;have exercised on our
economical life an extremely depressing effect, but
have produced no echo abroad: doubtless because
only those can understand the whole extent of our
misery who daily rub shoulders with the thousands
of starving and unemployed people who drag themselves
from one end of the town to the other in quest
of work that is not to be found, or who mingle with
the interminable files of women who go in search of
rations of bread and soup for their families.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<p>Let us briefly consider the principal causes of
famine which prevails in Belgium.</p>

<p>1. Exaggerated requisitions, out of all proportion to
the resources of the country. They are of two kinds:&mdash;</p>

<p>Firstly, those which have emptied the country of
grain, cattle, forage, and other foodstuffs.</p>

<p>Then the requisitions of the raw materials intended
for the factories, which have completely
paralysed industry, especially in the Flanders.
One example will suffice. All the workshops of
Termonde were burned save one&mdash;the Escaut-Dendre
establishment, which makes boots and
shoes. But the Germans sent into Germany both
the leather and the shoes which were in the warehouse.
The factory is thus condemned to stand
idle for lack of raw material, and also for lack of
funds. Those industries of which the machinery
has been removed are also, of course, doomed to
paralysis. The German authorities threaten to
despoil our factories of all the copper forming part
of the machinery, which would reduce them one and
all to impotence. It is an ironical fact that this
measure was announced by a propagandist leaflet
addressed to the Belgians.</p>

<p>2. Having made a clean sweep of the greater
portion of all that was indispensable to us, the
Germans have been careful to take our money
from us. Under every imaginable pretext, and
often without any pretext at all, they have imposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
crushing taxes upon us. The regular payment
of these taxes showing that the public coffers
were not yet quite empty, the Germans hastened to
impose fines upon us, which vary from 5 frs. to
5 millions. The private banks, too, are threatened
every moment with the removal of a portion of their
funds.</p>

<p>3. It is needless to insist on a third cause, which
reduces our working-class families to idleness and
poverty: the destruction of an enormous number of
factories&mdash;some bombarded, but most of them burned
of set purpose.</p>

<p>4. We have already seen that many factories
which remained intact are condemned to inactivity
by the lack of raw material, or because
they have been deprived of their machinery. The
others are equally paralysed.</p>

<p>The stoppage of traffic on the railway lines, the
impediments of all kinds placed in the way of inland
navigation, the absence of maritime navigation, are
causes more than sufficient to prevent the importation
of raw materials and the exportation of manufactured
products. Of all these obstacles the most
important is assuredly the suppression of goods
traffic on the railways. "Why," say the Germans,
"do not Belgian employés return to their work,
since our military trains would in any case be run
by our own men?" Hypocrites! The slowness and
irregularity of the trains is highly inconvenient to
the German army, and it would much like to see
them resume their normal speed; but for this it
requires the assistance of the Belgian staff. Is it
not obvious that if our railway-men resumed their
labours they would at the same time facilitate the
transport of German troops and munitions?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us again cite the prohibition of "circulation"
between 8 or 9 o'clock and 6 o'clock, which is an
obstacle to night work, which is quite indispensable
to the large industries; and the suppression of the
special trains by which the workers travelled.</p>

<p>5. Commerce has suffered no less than industry.
There is no telegraph, no telephone, no posting of
closed letters; that is, no means of sending or
receiving orders. No railway, no horses, no motor-cars
to deliver goods or to supply customers. And,
to cap all, the slightest journey necessitates all sorts
of exaggerated expenses: there is the acquisition of
a passport, the train journey at the rate of 10 cm.
per kilometre, hotel expenses, etc. The expenditure
might be a minor matter, but what of the waste of
time? Before 1st July, 1915, any one going from
Liége to Brussels for business purposes had first of
all to waste one or two days in procuring his passport;
the journey occupied at least half a day; and
after interviewing his client he would find that there
was no train back to Liége on the same day. In
short, he would have to allow four days for a journey
which in normal times took half a day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Other causes of famine are:</p>

<p>The scarcity and high cost of provisions.</p>

<p>The financial difficulties in which the public
powers are involved.</p>

<p>The paralysis of industry and commerce, resulting
in unemployment&mdash;that is, in suppression of wages.</p>

<p>In short, a diminution of resources, accompanied
by an increase of expenditure; so that the public
coffers are almost powerless to come to the aid of
private distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>That is how we stand in Belgium.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to depict the poignant
distress which has overwhelmed our country. We
shall merely explain briefly how we try to cope with
it; this will suffice to give some idea of it.</p>


<p><i>Creation of Temporary Shelters.</i></p>

<p>Let us first of all consider the country districts.
Even when a few houses only of a village have
escaped incendiarism the inhabitants have returned
thither and have resumed their customary labours.
Must they not plough and sow, under penalty of
preparing for themselves another year of wretchedness?
Where houses exist no longer they live in
a cellar, or an outhouse to which some kind of roof
has been improvised; families passed the winter of
1914-15 in a potato-silo,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> under the shelter of a few
mats of straw. In the ruined villages the first
anxiety of the public powers and the relief
committees was therefore to provide provisional
shelter.</p>

<p>In the towns and industrial districts the most
urgent necessities are of another kind. What is
lacking most particularly is employment. The
administrations have therefore set themselves to
provide the unemployed with paid occupations
which do not demand apprenticeship&mdash;the clearing
of ruins, the levelling of soil, the digging of reservoirs,
etc. The communal coffers being empty,
communal vouchers are issued. <i xml:lang="fr">L'Événement Illustré</i>,
in its fourth issue, gives reproductions of
some of these vouchers, of which, it states, there
are more than 500. In the communes near Louvain,
where the poverty is particularly poignant, it has
been necessary to create vouchers for 2 centimes
(at Wilsele) and 5 centimes (at Herent).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>From the outset stringent measures were taken to
make up for the insufficiency of provisions and to
prevent speculators from obtaining possession of
existing stocks. The most important of these
regulations are the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Fixing of maximum prices.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Prohibition of the exportation of provisions
from the commune.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) It is forbidden to give animals provisions
intended for human beings.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Collective exploitation. Many communes
have set up in business as bakers, butchers,
restaurant-keepers, coal merchants, dealers in
colonial produce, etc. They prepare bread and
soup daily, and these are provided gratuitously
to the poorest, or sold at a low price to those
who still have a few savings. In the Brussels
district there had been distributed by the 31st
January, 1915, to adults, 30,060,608 rations,
comprising soup and bread, and to the children
932,838 rations, consisting chiefly of milk,
phosphatine, and powdered milk.</p></blockquote>

<p>Certain communes also sell meat; others have
installed communal stores for the sale of all kinds
of provisions, especially preserved foods, dried vegetables,
salt, potatoes, etc.; almost everywhere coal
is sold retail; petroleum was sold as long as it
could be obtained. Moreover, the collectivities are
distributing enormous quantities of clothes; in the
Brussels district alone by the end of January
660,865 frs. worth of clothing and footwear had
been given to the necessitous. Abuses have as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
far as possible been guarded against, (1) by the
"household card," the <i xml:lang="fr">Carte de ménage</i>, which
indicates the number of persons composing each
family; and (2) by the limitation of the quantity
of each kind of goods which the household can
obtain during the week.</p>

<p>The basis of alimentation is bread. Therefore
particularly Draconian rules have been elaborated
for the bakeries.</p>


<p><i>The National Relief Committee.</i></p>

<p>Many problems presented themselves simultaneously,
and with an extreme urgency. In all
communes local committees have been set up,
entrusted with the equitable distribution of provisions
among all the inhabitants. We say "all
the inhabitants," for the reader must not form any
illusions as to our condition: there is not a single
Belgian family which, if left to itself, could obtain its
daily bread; the general rationing to which the
whole population is subjected makes rich and poor
equally dependent on the National Committee of
Relief and Alimentation.</p>

<p>To organize the feeding of the public would have
been a task above our strength if Belgium, in her
present distress, had been abandoned to her own
resources. But the misfortunes which have come
upon us because we could not consent to comply
with the orders of a tyrannical and perjured neighbour&mdash;the
poverty which cripples us more completely
day by day, as requisitions, pillage, taxes, and fines
deprive us of our last resources&mdash;the massacres and
the incendiarism which have turned into deserts the
most fertile and most densely peopled provinces of
Europe&mdash;the molestations and annoyances which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
have reduced to unemployment a working population
whose activity is proverbial&mdash;in short, the unmerited
misfortune which <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i> has inflicted upon us&mdash;all
this has awakened, in all the civilized nations, a
current of sympathy and solidarity with poor
Belgium.</p>

<p>By Germany our country was condemned to
perish of starvation. The miracle which alone
could save us has been effected by the charity of
Spain, Scandinavia, Holland, Italy, Switzerland,
New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the Argentine
Republic, Brazil, and, above all, the United States.
Since the month of November 1914 vessels laden
with provisions have been regularly leaving the
American ports for Rotterdam, whence the food is
despatched, principally by means of barges, into
Belgium, and distributed, in the smallest villages
even, by the care of the National Committee of
Relief and Alimentation. This Committee is an
extension throughout the whole country of a commission
which was formed early in September 1914
to succour the Brussels district; it is under the
patronage of their Excellencies the Marquis of
Villalobar, the Spanish Minister, and Mr. Brand
Whitlock, the United States Minister. In January
and February 1915 the Committee was induced to
concern itself also with the country round Maubeuge,
and the Givet&mdash;Furnay&mdash;Sedan district.</p>

<p>The mission of the National Committee is equitably
to distribute relief and provisions. But it
does not itself collect these resources; as they
derive more particularly from the United States it
is an American Committee, the "Commission for
Relief in Belgium," which undertakes to collect and
administer funds. It is the American Committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
which despatches to Rotterdam, from American
ports, the steamers carrying food and clothing. In
each province the American Commission has a
delegate who supervises the distribution of provisions
and relief; he assures himself that nothing is
diverted to the use of the German army. The
Commission for Relief in Belgium sits in London,
its chairman being Mr. Herbert Hoover.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A serious difficulty cropped up immediately.
Foreign beneficence was eager to aid the Belgians,
but not, obviously, the butchers who occupy our
country. It was therefore necessary at all costs
to prevent the German army from seizing the
provisions and subsidies despatched by America.</p>

<p>On the 16th October, 1914, the German authorities
undertook to exempt from all requisitions the provisions
imported by the National Committee. But
this promise was promptly violated. The Germans,
it is true, did not requisition the wheat, but they did
requisition the bread made from that wheat. Moreover,
they pretended that their engagement of the
16th October, 1914, general as it was, did not affect
Flanders, a <i xml:lang="fr">territoire d'étape</i> not subject to the
Governor-General. This is the effect of their letter
of the 21st November, 1914. Up to the present it
has been impossible to get them to keep the engagements
to which they subscribed on the 16th October;
for although they have extended to cattle-foods the
promise that nothing should be requisitioned by the
troops placed under the orders of the Governor-General&mdash;the
<i xml:lang="fr">territoire d'étape</i> being thus excluded&mdash;they
have, on the other hand, forced the communes
of Flanders to open grain markets, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
they make purchases, thus continuing to impoverish
the food-stores of the country.</p>

<p>While they exclude Flanders from the region
exempted from requisitions, they take care not to
breathe a word of this exemption in their own newspapers.
The <i>K.Z.</i>, on the 4th January, and <i xml:lang="de">Der
Volksfreund</i> on the 5th declared that requisitions
of foodstuffs were suspended throughout Belgium.</p>

<p>Despite the difficulties raised by the Germans, the
National Committee of Relief and Alimentation has
rendered our country inestimable services, which
only those who have visited our towns and rural
districts and have seen the work of the local
Committees can form any conception.</p>

<p>We borrow from the report of the Executive Committee
for the month of January 1915 (published in
Brussels 15th February, 1915) a few figures (<i>see</i>
table, p. <a href="#Page_176">176</a>) as to the distribution of relief during
the month of January.</p>

<p>But the National Committee extends its beneficent
action over many departments which are not mentioned
in this table.</p>

<p>Here, according to the same report, is the list of
these departments:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I. Department of Alimentation (Foodstuffs).<br />
II. Agricultural Section of the National Committee.<br />

<p>Since the month of January 1915 the National
Committee has not ceased to extend its activities.
But it is impossible to give more precise data. The
German authorities no longer permit the Committee
to publish its reports. In their dry, official manner
they show us only too clearly what we are to think
of the present "prosperity" of Belgium and the
"normal state of the situation."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be seen that the activities of the National
Committee are fruitful and extensive. But more
and more money is required, as savings are exhausted
and as the public coffers are emptied by the Germans.</p>

<p>In January 1915 the Sovereign Pontiff surrendered
the Belgian contribution to Peter's Pence.</p>

<p>As 40 million frs. per month (£1,600,000) is
being paid to the Germans, poverty is rapidly increasing.
The number of Belgians deprived of all
resources and obliged to live entirely on charity had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
risen by February to 1,500,000. It was estimated
that by June it would be 2,500,000, or more than
one-third of the total population. In February the
nourishment of this famishing host already demanded
10 million frs. (£400,000) per month; soon it will
demand 12 to 13 millions. In this conjuncture
Mr. Hoover, the President of the American Commission,
went begging to the British Government,
which promised £100,000 per month provided Germany
would cease to make requisitions in Flanders
and levy the tax of 40 millions. Germany refused.
How will it end?</p>


<p><i>Belgium's Gratitude to America.</i></p>

<p>Belgium knows that she owes her relief to the
United States. Without American charity our
country would perish in the distress into which the
German exactions have plunged her. No one in
Belgium will ever forget this, and it is in the name
of the whole nation that King Albert has publicly
thanked America.</p>

<p>It was in sign of homage, and also of gratitude,
that on the 22nd February, 1915, on the anniversary
of American Independence, the Belgians wore in their
buttonholes a medallion of the Stars and Stripes,
while thousands of the citizens of Brussels left their
cards at the hotel of His Excellency Mr. Brand H.
Whitlock. Baron von Bissing spoke of this as
childishness; at Liége German officers even snatched
the American colours from women and young girls.
Massacre and arson are more familiar to <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i> than
gratitude.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
THE GERMAN MIND, SELF-DEPICTED</h2>


<p>In those chapters in which we have dealt with the
violations of international treaties, and of the Hague
Convention, we have often been led to comment on
the mode of thought displayed by those who committed
these crimes. But hitherto we have touched
upon the subject of German mentality only in an
incidental fashion; it will doubtless be interesting to
consider it more closely.</p>

<p>We shall utilize, by preference, documents of
German origin. In cases where these are lacking, for
example, in the case of the cruelties committed, we
shall have recourse to observations which we ourselves
have collected, and whose authenticity is indisputable.</p>

<p>In place of passing in review all the peculiarities
of the modern German mind, which would occupy
too much space, we shall confine ourselves to those
from which Belgium has suffered most cruelly; but
we shall not speak&mdash;it would be superfluous&mdash;of the
obscene spirit of rape, and rapacity, and drunkenness.
The three psychological elements which we shall
consider are pride, duplicity, and spitefulness.</p>


<h3>A.&mdash;Pride.</h3>

<p><i>Some Manifestations of Pride and the Spirit of
Boasting.</i></p>

<p>"The German nation is the Chosen People, and
God is with us." That is the prevailing idea of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
speeches and proclamations of the Kaiser. In his
Speech from the Throne on the 4th August, 1914,
he declared: "It is not the spirit of conquest which
urges us forward; but we are animated by the inflexible
determination to retain the position in which
God has set us, for ourselves and for all the generations
to come."</p>

<p>In her pride Germany is unanimous. No German
is permitted to doubt the indisputable superiority of
his nation over all other nations. As soon as he
learns to lisp his first words, his brain is steeped in
the conviction that no people is comparable to his
own, even remotely.</p>

<p>This longing to exalt his own country is accompanied
by a corresponding desire to abase all others.
Hardly is a discovery of any kind made in a neighbouring
country than a German appropriates it in order to
give it a new trade-mark. One example will suffice.</p>

<p>All the world knows that Louis Pasteur was the
founder of the science of bacteriology, a science whose
consequences, in the spheres of hygiene and medicine,
are incalculable. Germany ignores Pasteur and has
heard only of Koch. A Belgian, who attended the
Berlin celebrations in honour of Koch, returned disgusted
with the fact that the name of Pasteur was
systematically suppressed throughout the ceremonies.
In an obituary notice devoted to Koch a Belgian
bacteriologist, M. Jules Bordet, remarked with great
justice, in speaking of the German biographies of the
scientist who had just died:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They made Koch the absolute creator of modern
medicine: all other glory pales before his; he is the
founder of bacteriology. Their obituary articles,
emanating, for the most part, from disciples of the
master, and which are, one feels, steeped in pious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
gratitude, and also, perhaps, to a certain extent,
in a somewhat exclusive patriotism, attribute to
him the honour of having shown the organic origin
of contagious diseases." "It would be," said Herr
Pfeiffer, the distinguished Breslau bacteriologist, "a
real act of justice were posterity to divide the history
of medicine into two periods, one before Koch and
the other after him."</p>

<p>Reading such notices it would almost seem as
though Pasteur had never lived!</p>

<p>We think M. Bordet shows himself far too indulgent
toward the German biographers when he says,
in conclusion: "And one could not take it amiss of
these disciples if, in their filial solicitude, they left
on the tomb of their Master a few leaves from the
laurels of Pasteur."</p>

<p>Here is another example of boasting, interesting
principally by reason of the <i>charlatanesque</i> manner
in which it was published. Every one has heard of
the Cooper-Hewitt mercury-vapour lamp, with its
strange blue-violet light, so rich in ultra-violet rays.
The most summary treatises on physics explain that
quartz will allow the ultra-violet rays to pass, and
that the Cooper-Hewitt quartz lamp is in constant
employment in the laboratories. But if you read the
communication which the Germans imposed upon
<i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> on the 27th December, 1914, you
will see that the Germans invented the whole affair.</p>

<p>If you want to be initiated into the perfections of
the German, Herr Momme Nissen, in <i xml:lang="de">Der Krieg und
die Deutsche Kunst</i>, will enumerate them for you.
"The qualities of the German," he says, "integrity
and courage, profundity of mind and fidelity, insight
and the sense of inwardness, modesty and piety, are
also the ornaments of our art."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>


<p><i>The Germans compare themselves with their Allies.</i></p>

<p>Here is a last point to be considered. The
Germans do not merely consider themselves to be
superior to their adversaries; they are equally modest
on behalf of their allies. To their minds, and in their
writings, the present war is "the German war." The
most complete chronological compilation which has
appeared hitherto is entitled <i xml:lang="de">Chronik des Deutschen
Krieges</i>. The official publications deliberately ignore
the Austrians, Hungarians, Czechs, Croats, Turks,
etc. The first of the pamphlets of propaganda distributed
by the Germans (<i xml:lang="fr">Journal de la Guerre</i>)
begins thus: "The name this war will one day bear
in history is already determined; it can only be the
<i>German War</i>, for it is a war destined to establish
the position of the German nation in the world."
By what name shall we call the German's sense of
superiority over all other nations: is it pride, presumption,
or impudence?</p>

<p>Herr Paul Rohrbach, who is generally more
moderate in his expressions, has written a pamphlet
entitled <i xml:lang="de">Warum es der Deutsche Krieg ist</i> ("Why
this is the German War").</p>

<p>It would be useless to insist on the general aspects
of the question. Let us consider only a few of the
immediate consequences of this frame of mind:
militarism, disdain for others, cynicism, and absence
of the critical spirit.</p>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Militarism.</span></h3>

<p><i>Might comes before Right.</i></p>

<p>Bismarck has given us a precise formula of the
cult of brute force, "Might comes before right!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Nietzsche has gone further, "Might creates right."
"You say that a good cause sanctifies even war?
I tell you that a good war sanctifies any cause!"
(<i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i>).</p>

<p>Herr Maximilian Harden, the well-known polemical
writer, expressed the same idea in a lecture delivered
at Duisbourg and reproduced in <i>K.Z.</i> (8th December,
1914). It is expressed with equal lucidity in an
article published in <i xml:lang="de">Zeit im Bild</i> (19th November,
1914), and signed <i>Vitus Bug</i>; the author, after
inquiring into the reasons which make Germany
hated, adds: "Let us be victorious, and people
will immediately discover that we were in the
right!"</p>

<p>It is, consequently, towards the army that the
essential aspirations of the German nation converge;
everything must give way to the military interest;
the moment this is in question there is no longer any
room for morality, says Professor Rein, of the University
of Jena (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 22nd January, 1915, morning),
nor for humanity, says Herr Erzberger (<i>N.R.C.</i>,
6th February, 1915, evening), nor even for the law
of nations, declares Professor Beer, of the University
of Leipzig (<i xml:lang="de">Völkerrecht und Krieg</i>). In other countries
people have remained simple enough to believe
that it is precisely in time of war that the prescriptions
of international law should be most strictly
respected. Nothing of the sort, say the Germans;
the moment war breaks out everyday justice can
only efface itself. On the slightest accusation, the
least pretext, or even without any, they begin to
shoot and to burn. If by accident those put to
death are innocent, or if there was in truth no complaint
to be made against the inhabitants of the
houses burned to ashes, it is obviously regrettable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
but such commonplace considerations will not
prevent the German army from inflicting on the
nearest village a punishment any less exemplary.
<i xml:lang="de">Es ist Krieg</i>: in this phrase is contained the whole
psychology of the German soldier in war-time. "Do
you suppose," said a German at Louvain, "that
we've got time to make inquiries?" (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 9th
September, 1914, morning). "You understand
clearly," said an officer at Francorchamps, "that
we cannot stop the German army to inquire if this
man has really fired on us; he was accused of
doing so; isn't that sufficient reason for shooting
him?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before leaving the subject of militarism, we will
cite one insignificant fact which, however trifling,
clearly reveals the importance which the military
idea has assumed in the conceptions of the German
people. According to the <i>N.R.C.</i> of the 6th February,
1915 (evening), <i xml:lang="de">Vorwärts</i> has protested against
the following measure: The German wife whose
husband is under arms cannot be expelled from her
dwelling for non-payment of rent; but if her husband
should be killed in the war the landlord immediately
recovers the right to turn her out.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Disdain of Others.</span></h3>

<p>We have seen that the Germans are seeking by
all possible means to accentuate their superiority
over their neighbours. An elementary procedure
for increasing the vertical distance between them
and their rivals consists in depreciating the latter.
Germany has so often, in every tone of voice, proclaimed
the irremediable inferiority of all the other
peoples inhabiting our planet, that she has at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
come to believe it herself, and has begun to act in
conformity with her belief.</p>


<p><i>Some Inept Proclamations, etc.</i></p>

<p>Thus, to speak only of our own experience, they
assuredly under-estimated our national integrity
when they believed us capable of becoming accomplices
in the violation of an international treaty.
They also greatly under-estimated our army's powers
of resistance, or they would have taken good care
not to lose a fortnight in Belgium, a delay which
spoiled their sudden attack upon France. Finally,
they show us every day, by their placards, that they
do not think much of our intelligence. Some of those
entitled "News published by the German General
Government" are really inimitable.</p>

<p>Imagine our laughter when the authorities to
whom we are forced to submit officially announced
that a German squadron had captured fifteen fishing-boats;
or that the Serbians had taken Semlin in
order to obtain food; or that the star of Paschitsch
was growing pale; or that the Austrians had
evacuated Lemberg for strategic and humanitarian
reasons; or that the British Army is so ill-equipped
that the soldiers are without writing-paper and shoelaces;
or that the river of the "gifts of love" continues
to flow; or that General Joffre (in a French
that could only have come from a German pen)
informs his troops that "the moment is come to
profit by the weakness which offers itself to us,
after we have reinforced ourselves in men and
material." In the last days of September 1914,
when a citizen of Brussels met a fair-haired
comrade, he hastened to measure him, to make
sure that he was not Charles-Alice Yate, "being
about 5 ft. 9 in. in height."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are some of these placards:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">News published by the German Government.</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <i>6th September, 1914</i>.&mdash;The Austria-Hungarian Ambassador
publishes the following dispatch which has been forwarded
to him by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Vienna:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Russian news on the subject of the battle of Lemberg and
the triumphant capture of the city is a lie. The open town of
Lemberg was evacuated by us without a battle for strategical and
humanitarian reasons."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <i>22nd September, 1914</i>.&mdash;On the night of the 19th

Yorkshire Light Infantry, escaped from Torgau, where he was
prisoner of war. Yate is that English officer of superior rank
concerning whom it was announced the other day that he did not
deny, upon inquiry, that the English troops have been supplied
with dum-dum bullets; in the course of this interrogatory he
declared that the soldier must obviously use the ammunition
which is furnished to him by the Government.</p>

<p>The fugitive is about 5 ft. 9 in. in height; he is slender, fair-haired,
and speaks German well.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">The German General Government.</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Vienna</span>, <i>29th September, 1914</i>.&mdash;The <i xml:lang="de">Reichspost</i> announces
from Sofia: The correspondent of the <i>Volja</i>, the organ of Ghenadjev,
writes from Nish: The Austrian offensive has serious
consequences for Serbia; rebellion is muttering in the country
and the army, and every day may see the outbreak of the
revolution. During the last few days several regiments of
artillery have revolted. A certain number of guns have been
demolished....</p>

<p>King Peter has returned; he is completely apathetic, and the
Crown Prince Alexander does not know what to do. The star of
Paschitsch is paling, and it is feared there may soon be victims
in his entourage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>6th October, 1914</i>.&mdash;The <i>Daily Chronicle</i> announces
that at Aldershot, in round figures, 135,000 militia belonging to
all arms should be prepared to depart for the army as soon as
they are ready. However, the training, despite the most brilliant
efforts, could not give satisfactory results, the troops being
insufficiently equipped. The newspaper appeals for the assistance
of the public, and remarks that, for example, no officer of
Lord Kitchener's first army possesses field-glasses. They also
lack socks, handkerchiefs, shoelaces, writing-paper and materials,
and drums and fifes for the Scottish regiments.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">The German General Government.</span><br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>What is even more strange than their insistence in
offering us their sophisticated views, is their virtuous
indignation when they discover that we are not
receptive of this kind of truth. Thus the people of
Liége, who would not believe the German placards
and preferred their secret newspapers, were warned
by Lieut.-General von Kolewe that they were in
danger of appearing ridiculous in the eyes of
intelligent people.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">To the Population of Liége and Neighbourhood.</span></div>

<p>Considering the continual successes of the German troops, it is
impossible to understand why the people of Liége are still so
credulous as to believe the absurd and frivolous news spread by
the manufactories of falsehoods installed in Liége. Those who
busy themselves in propagating such news are risking severe
punishment. They are playing a dangerous game in abusing the
credulity of their fellow-citizens and in inciting them to reckless
actions. The reasonable population of Liége will resist all
temptations of the kind.</p>

<p>Otherwise it is exposing itself not merely to the gravest disappointment,
but also to appearing ridiculous in the eyes of
intelligent people.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Kolewe</span>,<br />
<i>Lieut.-General and German Governor of the<br />
Fortress of Liége</i>.<br />
</div>

<p><i>It is forbidden to tear down this placard or to paste another
over it.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Lies concerning the Situation in Belgium.</i></p>

<p>Before other placards the shrugging of shoulders
gave way to disgust. Baron von der Goltz, at
Sofia, boasted of having rendered "the situation
in Belgium entirely normal." What of it? We
were so glad to be rid of him that we were
ready to overlook any ineptitudes. But when
his successor, Baron von Bissing, after levying
a contribution of 480 million frs. (£19,200,000),
had the audacity to declare that he hoped "to
do much for the economic situation," and would
especially apply himself "to doing everything
to assist the weak in Belgium, and to encourage
them," he passed the bounds of cynicism and presumption.
However, two months later, on the 18th
February, 1915, after having despoiled us of 120
million francs, he found occasion to go still farther,
affirming his "solicitude for the welfare and prosperity
of the population."</p>


<p><i>Lies concerning "Francs-tireurs."</i></p>

<p>What shall we say of the accusations made against
Belgian civilians? From August, at the time of the
first sortie of our troops from Antwerp, the Germans
posted up statements in Brussels that the Belgian
population was again taking part in the conflict.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Official Statement by the Commandant of the German
Army.</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, <i>28th August, 1914</i>.&mdash;On the 26th and 27th August
several Belgian divisions made a sortie from Antwerp in order to
attack our lines of communication, but they were repulsed by
those of our troops left behind to invest the city. Five Belgian
guns fell into our hands....</p>

<p>The Belgian population almost everywhere took part in the
fighting. It became necessary to take the most drastic measures
to repress the bands of <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>....</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Now certain of these battles took place at a
distance of only six miles from Brussels; peasants
were shot at Houtem (a hamlet of Vilvorde) and at
Eppeghem: that is, in villages whence people went
into the city every morning with vegetables, milk,
etc., so that the inhabitants of the capital were perfectly
informed as to the behaviour of the German
troops toward the Belgian civilians. They knew,
too, that these pretended attacks of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"
had been delivered by detachments of the Belgian
army (<i>see</i> E. Waxweiler in <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique neutre et
loyale</i>, p. 219). The keen indignation against the
German liars was still further aggravated when,
three weeks later, the Kaiser repeated these calumnies.
The fact of their having placarded the walls
of Brussels with these obviously false accusations
shows once more in what low esteem the Germans
hold the mental faculties of their victims.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">News published by the German Government.</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, <i>7th October</i>.&mdash;From the leader of a troop of cyclists
near Hennuyères written instructions were taken, intended for the
leaders of the so-called "destructive detachment," in which they
are told, among other things: "Spread false news: landing of the
English at Antwerp, Russians at Calais."</p></blockquote>

<p>That the Germans should seek to deceive their
own compatriots as to the situation is natural enough&mdash;they
are quite content with official news. But in
Belgium we still, in spite of all obstacles, continue to
receive foreign newspapers, which keep us informed
of the military operations. Why, then, did the
Germans try to impose on us over the battle of
the Marne, when nothing was easier than to learn
the truth from the <i>Times</i> and the French Press?</p>

<p>A still more curious case was that of the battle of
Ypres. During a whole fortnight the official placards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
daily informed the Belgians of the latest German
success ... and at the end of three weeks the army
was still as far from Ypres. The whole of this Yser
campaign is interesting as throwing a light upon the
German mentality. From the outset the Germans
tried to establish a confusion between the "canalized"
Yser and the "canalized" Yperlée, that is,
the canal running from Ypres to the Yser. What
they call "the canal of the Yser" in their placard
of the 22nd October is the canalized Yser between
Dixmude and Nieuport. In the placard of the 2nd
November they spoke of the "canal from the Yser
to Ypres, near Nieuport," an absolutely fantastic
description. Finally, on the 4th April, when they
claimed to have crossed "the Yser canal" to occupy
Driegrachten, it was really the Yperlée that was in
question, and not the Yser at all. This is, as will be
seen, on a par with the intentional confusion which
they sought to create between the city of Liége and
its forts (pp. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>, <a href="#Page_58">58</a>). Such confusions may deceive
the Germans, but the Belgians, familiar with the
geography of their country, naturally laugh at them.</p>

<p>Another point relating to this astonishing campaign
on the Yser: On the 2nd November the
Germans announced that operations were rendered
difficult by the inundation. On the following day,
having expressed their pity for the Belgians "whose
fields were devastated for a long time to come," they
added that the water was in parts deeper than a
man's height, but that they had lost neither man,
nor horse, nor gun. How can they impose such idle
stuff on people who know the <i>polders</i> of the coast
region, with their innumerable canals and ditches,
and who know, moreover, than an inundation there
renders all retreat impossible?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Cynicism.</span></h3>

<p>They must require a good stock of effrontery to put
before us such assertions as that of the Kaiser, whose
falsity is obvious at sight. They cannot be ignorant
of the fact that these impostures are instantly
exposed. But this consideration does not give them
pause; German superiority appears to them so indisputable
that they have no need to trouble about the
opinion of other people; if they occasionally indicate
the reasons for their actions, it is to reassure their
own conscience, not to justify themselves to their
victims. They are, in short, in the situation of the
sportsman who brings down the game passing within
gunshot, but is not required to render an account of
it to the rabbits and partridges. To the sportsman's
way of thinking there is no cynicism in so acting:
between the hunter and the game there is too great
a difference to make such a justification necessary.
Similarly, the Germans occupy, in the scale of
<i>Kultur</i>, so exalted a position as compared with
the Belgians, that they believe in good faith that
all is permitted to them in dealing with this horde,
and that they need not justify their actions. They
behave toward us as the Conquistadores toward the
Aztecs.</p>

<p>More, they actually advertise their contempt for
the rules of justice. We have already mentioned the
placard posted at Gand, according to which they
openly placed themselves in conflict with the Hague
Convention. They have gone yet farther in this
direction. What are we to say, for example, of the
placard posted at Menin, in July 1915, by order of
Commandant Schmidt, in which it is ordained that
the families of those "who do not work regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
on the military works" shall be allowed to die of
starvation?</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Order.</span></div>

<p>From to-day the town can no longer grant relief&mdash;of whatever
kind, even for families, women and children&mdash;save only to those
workmen who are working regularly on the military works and
on other works prescribed.</p>

<p>All other workmen and their families cannot henceforth be
assisted in any way whatever.</p></blockquote>

<p>And this is not the gem of the collection. At
Roubaix and the vicinity (in French Flanders, close
against the Belgian frontier) they advertised their
decision to prevent all sales of comestibles if work
were not resumed by the 7th July, and they even
threatened completely to suppress "circulation,"
which would have resulted in the lingering death
of the whole population.</p>

<p>And this is not the worst. In a neighbouring
town, Halluin, Commandant Schranck caused a
declaration to be read to the assembled notables
which stated that he denied their right to invoke
the Hague Convention, since the German military
authorities had determined to enforce the fulfilment
of all their demands, "even if a city of 15,000 inhabitants
had to perish."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>Read at Halluin, on the 30th June, at 11.30 p.m., to the
Municipal Council and notables of the Town of Halluin.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>What is happening is known to all these gentlemen. It is
the conception and interpretation of Article 52 of the Hague
Convention which has created difficulties between you and the
German military authority. On which side is the right? It is
not for us to discuss that, for we are not competent, and we shall
never arrive at an understanding on this point. It will be the
business of the diplomatists and the representatives of the various
States after the war.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<p>To-day it is exclusively the interpretation of German military
authority which is valid, and for that reason we intend that all
that we shall need for the maintenance of our troops shall be
made by the workers of the territory occupied. I can assure you
that the German authority will not under any circumstances
desist from demanding its rights, even if a town of 15,000 inhabitants
should have to perish. The measures introduced up to
the present are only a beginning, and every day severe measures
will be taken until our object is obtained.</p>

<p>This is the last word, and it is good advice I give you to-night.
Return to reason, and arrange for the workers to resume work
without delay; otherwise you will expose your town, your families,
and your persons to the greatest misfortunes.</p>

<p>To-day, and perhaps for a long time yet, there is for Halluin
neither a prefecture nor a French Government. There is only
one will, and that is the will of German authority.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Do you not agree that a cynicism so shameless is
a sign of perplexity and an admission of impotence?
The Germans realize that they are driven to the
worst expedients!</p>

<p>A host of similar facts might be cited, but it would
mean useless repetition. Let us rather examine some
examples of graphic cynicisms.</p>


<p><i>Photographs and Picture Postcards.</i></p>

<p>The Germans have published, in their newspapers,
photographs representing the population of a village,
consisting principally of women, being driven away
as prisoners (<i xml:lang="de">Berl. Ill. Zeit.</i>, No. 36, 6th September,
1914); a military observation-post installed by them
on the tower of Malines Cathedral during the siege
of Antwerp (<i xml:lang="de">Berl. Ill. Zeit</i>., No. 44, 1st November,
1914); doctors detained as prisoners in Germany,
contrary to the Geneva Convention (<i xml:lang="de">Berl. Ill. Zeit.</i>,
No. 15, 11th April, 1915); soldiers taken prisoners,
whom they are forcing, despite Article 6 of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Hague Convention, to do work directed against
their country (<i xml:lang="de">Die Wochenschau</i>, No. 44, 1914).</p>

<p>We find the same effrontery in respect of the
conflagrations started by their troops: Scharr and
Dathe, of Trèves, have edited and placed on sale,
in Belgium itself, a series of fifty picture postcards,
representing localities which the German army has
destroyed by fire. We may mention Dinant, Namur,
Louvain, Aerschot, Termonde; and in Belgium,
Luxemburg, Barranzy, Etalles, Èthe, Izel, Jamoigne,
Musson, Eossignol, Tintigny. Let us add that
these photographs commonly show German soldiers
and officers striking triumphant attitudes amid the
ruins. The most instructive card of this kind which
we have seen is one representing General Beeger
amid the ruins of Dinant. To understand the full
significance of this card, one must remember that
it was this officer who ordered 1,200 of the houses
of Dinant to be burned and 700 of the inhabitants
to be massacred. It is surprising that he did not
have a few corpses of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>" arranged
about him when the photograph was taken&mdash;preferably
selected from the old men, women, and
children at the breast.</p>

<p>After the torpedoing of the <i>Lusitania</i> they sold in
Belgium a series of cards entitled <i xml:lang="de">Kriegs-Errinerungs-Karte</i>,
edited by Dr. Trenkler &amp; Co., of Leipzig,
which pictured the operations of submarines. Card
No. 2, of Series XXXIII, represents&mdash;very inaccurately,
by the way&mdash;a German submarine stopping
the <i>Lusitania</i>. It is as well to recall the fact that
in this disaster more than 1,500 non-combatants
perished, among them Mme. Antoine Depage, the
wife of the well-known Belgian surgeon.</p>

<p>Nothing ought to surprise us on the part of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
who prove that every means is good provided it is
efficacious. Here is what a newspaper, much respected
in Germany, the <i xml:lang="de">Hamburger Fremdenblatt</i>,
has to say in its weekly illustrated supplement for
the 16th May, 1915:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the situation in which Germany now finds herself, attacked
on three sides at once with all the means that cruelty and perfidy
can invent, we must not ask ourselves whether a means of defence
is permitted or prohibited; but whether it is effectual. All that
facilitates the defence must be employed; this is especially true
of the submarine war, and consequently of the destruction of the
<i>Lusitania</i>."</p></blockquote>


<p><i>Alfred Heymel on the Battle of Charleroi.</i></p>

<p>We have already spoken of the articles of Alfred
Heymel and Walter Blöm. Here are some extracts
from an article by the former:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Battle of Charleroi.</span></div>

<p>One regiment of cavalry was detrained near the enemy frontier.
For a little while it halted on a man&oelig;uvring ground where the division
to which we were to be attached as scouts was to assemble.</p>

<p>Already many of us were impatient at having to wait longer
before marching to the front; we heard the growling thunder of
the howitzers of the great fortress near the frontier, around which
there had been violent fighting these last few days; we were told
of cruelties that made our hair stand on end, committed, in its
fury, by a people which had for years been excited against us
deeds of cruelty committed against our compatriots, soldiers,
civilians, women and children, because of our violation of a
neutrality which it had itself violated a thousand times over
in advance. On our side we were boiling inwardly to avenge
these infamies.... We breathed more freely only when, in our
march beyond the frontier, we saw the first houses burned in
reprisal; a curé, who had revolted, was hanging from a tree in
a neighbouring thicket, swinging at the will of the wind, when at
last the noise of battle grew plainer....</p>

<p>(They arrive near Charleroi.)</p>

<p>The head of one regiment, led by my friend Lieutenant S&mdash;&mdash;,
trotted forward again, and seized as hostages what civilians it
could catch; some 12 to 16 persons, old and young, fat and thin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
had to march before or between the lancers; more, this portion
of the regiment had received the order from its comrades not to
ride too far ahead.</p>

<p>Something that alarmed me quite particularly, giving me a
presentiment of misfortune, was the fact that the wives of these
civilians burst into weeping: one red-headed woman, frantic,
threw herself down in the road and gave vent to wild screams;
others, behind us, their emaciated arms stretched in the air,
threatened us, although they were several times assured that so
long as nothing was done to us nothing would happen to their
husbands, sons, friends, and lovers. All these significant scenes
took place in the side streets....</p>

<p>(A volley is fired from a barricade&mdash;or a railway crossing the
street; it is not clear which.)</p>

<p>I saw two or three cavalrymen fall back in front, and with them
the hostages fell to the ground; my friend was standing, near his
horse. A violent and rapid fire alternated with volleys; we
could not escape on either side; naturally we immediately faced
about and returned in the direction whence we had come; there
was a furious pursuit along the uneven road, with the balls
whistling at our backs. The horses fell, one after another....</p>

<p>Thus from the advance-guard we had become the rear-guard.
We had to consider how we could regain the main body of the
troop. In the first place hostages were taken, some curés
among them; the cavalry and artillery were no longer marching
alone and unprotected, but flanked by the infantry and
pioneers; one soon learns when once one has been caught.
With great difficulty we again penetrated the streets in the
smoke and heat, in the midst of the flames we ourselves had lit;
now we continually heard the popping of cartridges, bursting
harmlessly, piled up in the houses, and betraying the friendly
intention of the ex-inmates!<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>...</p>

<p>We learned later, when we had found the uniforms, that two
battalions of crack French infantry were distributed everywhere,
in order to organize and discipline the fire of the Belgian civic
guard and the <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>. The rumour (of marksmen on
the neighbouring heights) spread.... I thought I perceived&mdash;this
chilled my heart, and I still hope I was mistaken&mdash;that my
cavalrymen, otherwise so brave, did not really feel inclined to go
forward; their gait became slower and slower; they continually
observed more minutiæ and took a longer time in seizing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>civilians; in short, I saw the necessity of intervening, at need,
against my own troops, the most heart-breaking thing that can
happen to you in war. In any case I prepared myself, with a
heart full of pain, to face even the abyss of this prospect....</p>

<p>We must not overlook an article by Captain Walter
Blöm, adjutant to General von Bissing. Herr Blöm,
who is greatly admired in Germany, and whose novels
may be seen at this moment on the shelves of the
travellers' libraries installed in our railway stations,
does not hesitate to declare that the conflagrations
at Battice and Dinant were not intended to punish
the population, but to terrorize them (p. <a href="#Page_84">84</a>). The
article already mentioned, which incidentally describes
the shooting of a French hostage, is highly
typical. One sees that the death of this man&mdash;shot
because the French army does not consent to cease
its bombardment&mdash;does not in the least affect the
writer, who finds the conduct of his countrymen
quite natural.</p>

<p>Referring to the systematic pillage effected by the
German army, we have already mentioned (p. <a href="#Page_132">132</a>)
the fact that "war booty" was despatched openly.
In this respect, effrontery and impudence have surely
nowhere been carried to greater lengths than in the
valley of the Meuse. All the villas were as a matter
of course emptied by the officers; when they were
situated close to the banks of the river the furniture,
etc., was transported on a little steamer, one of
those tourist boats which in summer run between
Namur and Dinant. The boat would stop before
each villa, and&mdash;without the least attempt to conceal
the nature of the proceedings&mdash;the pianos, beautiful
pieces of furniture, clocks, pictures, etc., were piled
on the deck. To cite one case among hundreds, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
was thus that the villa of Mme. Wodon, at Davos,
was emptied.</p>

<p>Cynicism and impudence often lend one another
mutual support. Let us recall, for example, the
question of asphyxiating gases. Article 23 of the
Hague Convention forbids the employment of
poisons. Even in the siege of Liége our enemies
were making use of shells which discharged poisonous
gases at the moment of explosion; it was one of
them that all but poisoned General Leman. It
might, however, be supposed that these toxic vapours
were the inevitable result of the detonation of the
explosives with which the shells were loaded. But
in April 1915 the Germans suddenly began to accuse
their adversaries of the use of asphyxiating shells
(see the German official communiqués of the 9th,
12th, 14th, and 21st April). At the same time they
made it known that their chemists, far abler than
those of France or England, were about to combine
substances whose detonation would liberate products
far more toxic than those of the enemy's shells.
And on the 22nd April they preceded their attack on
the trenches to the north of Ypres by a cloud of
smoke of a yellowish-green colour, which asphyxiated
the French and Canadians (see <i>N.R.C.</i>, 29th April,
1914, morning). Now the falsity of their bragging
allegations is obvious. They will not persuade any
one to believe that between the 8th of April and the
22nd May they had had time to invent the combination
of substances capable of giving off toxic vapours,
to manufacture them in sufficient quantities, and
finally to forward the cylinders to the field of
battle.</p>

<p>Let us add, moreover, that we knew before the
end of March&mdash;that is, before the accusations made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
against the French&mdash;that the Germans were making
experiments on a large scale in the aviation camp
at Kiewit, near Hasselt. They were asphyxiating
dogs. It may be supposed that they presently
realized that they had gone a little too far in their
cynicism, for in its issue of the 3rd May, 1915,
<i xml:lang="de">Die Wochenschau</i>, commenting on the affair of the
22nd April, stated that the attack had been
"ably seconded by technical means."</p>

<p>Still, the palm for cynicism goes to the high
authorities. What are we to think of Baron von
der Goltz, whose proclamations state that the
innocent and guilty will be punished without
distinction? (p. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>). Here we begin to see into
the mentality of the Germans; swollen with pride,
they consider that all things are permitted to them
as against a people so uncivilized as the Belgians.</p>

<p>Well, incredible as it may seem, the Germans
have surpassed themselves in this department. The
same action, accordingly as it is performed by them
or against them, is denounced as a crime or highly
approved. We have already seen this in connection
with the bombardment of towns by aeroplanes
and dirigibles. What shall we say of the action
of the German cavalryman, who, surprised by
superior forces, surrendered; but, as he was giving
up his arms thought better of it, broke the head
of one of his adversaries, and fled. If a Belgian or
a Frenchman had been guilty of such treachery the
Germans could not have found sufficient terms
of abuse to heap upon his head; but as he was a
German his action became <i xml:lang="de">ein kühnes Reiterstückchen</i>
(a "Bold exploit of a Cavalryman"). More&mdash;this
incident is reported in the first number of the
pamphlets of propaganda distributed by order of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
German authorities&mdash;the <i xml:lang="fr">Journal de la Guerre</i>.
Not only do they find no cause for blame in a soldier
who has committed so vile an action; they are
proud of him, and take pains to celebrate his glory
in neutral countries.</p>

<p>Here are two other examples, bearing on matters
of much greater importance. On the 4th August,
1914, the very day on which they were violating
the neutrality of Belgium, and were commencing to
punish us, at Visé, for having dared to resist them,
they expressed their satisfaction in the fact that
Switzerland was scrupulously remaining neutral.
M. Waxweiler (p. 52) calls our attention to this
contradiction in their attitude toward the two
neutral countries&mdash;Belgium and Switzerland. Moreover,
they had the impudence to placard their
satisfaction in the neutrality of Switzerland about
the streets of Brussels.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">News published by the German General Government.</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Berne</span>, <i>7th February</i>.&mdash;The representative of the Bund has
been received in Berlin by Herr von Jagow, Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, who spoke of Switzerland in the most
friendly manner. Herr von Jagow says: The strictly neutral
attitude of Switzerland has produced the most favourable impression
in Germany. We take a very keen interest in a neutral,
independent, and powerful Switzerland.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">The General Government in Belgium.</span><br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>While in Belgium they burn houses and torture
civilians, on the pretext that the latter have fired on
them, they congratulate the Hungarian peasants
who took up arms to defend their country against
the Russian invader. The contrast here is so
obvious that it even struck one German&mdash;Herr
Maximilian Harden. In an article in <i>Jingoism, a
Disease of the Mind</i>, he reproaches his compatriots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
with having two weights and two measures (published
in <i xml:lang="de">Vorwärts</i>, August 1914).</p>

<p>They push their effrontery to the point of photographing
their own <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>, so that no doubt
may be left in our minds. The <i xml:lang="de">Berl. Ill. Zeit.</i> of the
16th March, 1915 (p. 261), gives a photograph
"from the theatre of the war in the Carpathians"&mdash;"Ruthenian
Peasant employed in the Austro-Hungarian
Army to guard roads and telegraph-lines."
The peasant, without uniform, carries a rifle.</p>

<p>Lastly, let us cite a case in which cynicism is
allied to pedantry. On the calcined walls of the
Hôtel de Ville of Dinant (burned on the 23rd and
24th August, 1914) is a chronogram. The letters
are cut in a slab of marble let into the wall
facing the Meuse. The fire had rendered the inscription
illegible, but the commandant of the town, in
March 1915, had the slab re-painted black and the
letters re-gilt. This is the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">paX et saLVs<br />
neVtra LItateM<br />
serVant IBVs DetVr.</span><br />
<br />
("May peace and security be granted to those who preserve
neutrality.")<br />
(1637.)
</div>

<p>Herr Otto Eduard Schmidt, returning from the
French front by way of Dinant, was struck by this
inscription. "I could not learn for certain," he
says, "by questioning passing soldiers of the Landsturm,
whether the inscription had lately been placed
there or had merely been re-gilt. But in any case,
I should regard it an insult to German authority,
and I am astonished that this insult should be
tolerated" (O. E. Schmidt, <i xml:lang="de">Eine Fahrt zu den
Sachsen an die Front</i>, p. 131). What would Herr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Schmidt say if he knew that it was his own countrymen
who, in a fit of shameless cynicism, caused this
inscription to be renovated?</p>


<p><i>Surrender of the Critical Spirit. Refusal to
Examine the Accusations of Cruelty.</i></p>

<p>Painfully moved by the horrors committed in
Belgium, M. Charles Magnet, the National Grand
Master of Belgian Freemasonry, wrote on the 9th
September to nine German lodges, requesting them
to institute, by common consent, an inquiry into the
facts. Since the Germans denied the atrocities of
which their troops were accused, and, on the other
hand, were accusing the Belgians of maltreating the
wounded, such an inquiry could only have a happy
result. Two lodges only replied. "The request is
superfluous; this inquiry would be an insult to our
army," replied the Darmstadt lodge. "Our troops
are not ill-conducted; it would even be dangerous to
recommend them to display sensibility and kindness,"
replied the Bayreuth lodge.</p>

<p>The argument may be summarized thus: "We
know, as Germans, that we possess the truth; it is
useless, therefore, to go in search of it with the help
of an impartial commission." In a second letter
M. Magnet commented on these evasions, as contrary
to the spirit of brotherhood as to the scientific spirit.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that the refusal to examine,
objectively and impartially, the German and the
Belgian accusations, is peculiar to Freemasonry. On
the 24th January, 1915, Cardinal Mercier requested
the German authorities in Belgium to set up a commission
comprising both Germans and Belgians,
under the presidency of a representative of a neutral
country. His request was accorded no reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the Germans refuse to allow any light to be
thrown on their actions and those of the Belgians.
Why this opposition to a faithful search for the
truth? They fear, perhaps, that the truth will be
unfavourable to them. That is undoubtedly one of
their reasons; but we do not think it can be the only
reason; and the principal reason for their refusal
is without doubt the voluntary blindness to which
they have one and all subjected themselves since the
outbreak of the war.</p>

<p>They have decided, one would imagine, to accept,
without any discussion, whatever is decreed by
authority, which they invest with the absolute truth;
every German calmly receives that portion of the
truth which the Government thinks fit to dispense to
its faithful, and no German permits himself to ask
for more. <i xml:lang="la">Magister dixit</i>: the Staff has spoken!</p>

<p>Since the month of August a strict censorship has
been exercised over the Press. <i xml:lang="de">Vorwärts</i> and other
Socialist sheets have several times been suspended.
The <i xml:lang="de">Kölnischer Volkszeitung</i> was suspended on the
11th September, 1914, for having published articles
disposing of at least a part of the so-called Belgian
atrocities.... And then, apparently, it proceeded
to take them for granted; for afterwards it even
aggravated the accusations brought against the
Belgians.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="de">Vossische Zeitung</i> itself, official as it is, had
its issue of the 1st December, 1914, seized on
account of an article on a commission of the Reichstag
(<i>N.R.C.</i>, 3rd December, 1914, evening). At the
same time the Government was careful to stop all
foreign books and newspapers. This prohibition is so
strict that Dutch working-men going to work in
Germany are not allowed to wrap their sandwiches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in newspaper (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 10th December, 1914,
evening).</p>

<p>In Germany even people are beginning to find the
censorship a little too strict. Before the Budget
Commission of the Reichstag Herr Scheidemann, the
Socialist deputy, complained that in the district of
Rüstringen certain of the German official communiqués
even were prohibited. The newspapers
may not leave blank the spaces caused by the censorship,
as the latter must not appear. At Strasburg
the censorship prohibited the publication of articles
dealing with the increased price of milk. At
Dortmund the Socialist newspapers were subjected
to a preventive censorship for having inserted an
article by the sociologist Lujo Brentano, one of the
"Ninety-three," professor at the University of
Münich (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 16th May, 1913, morning).</p>

<p>Does the German public, knowing that the newspapers
publish none but articles inspired by
authority, or at least controlled thereby, accept
this sophisticated mental pabulum in good part?
Or does it make an effort to procure foreign publications?
One must believe that it does not, for in
that case the "intellectuals," better informed, would
cease to blindly accept the official declarations.</p>

<p>"But," it will perhaps be said, "since the
Government forbids the introduction of foreign
newspapers, it is radically impossible to obtain
them." We do not know just how the Germans
could obtain pamphlets and newspapers, but we do
know that in Belgium we read prohibited literature
every day&mdash;French, Dutch, and English. Any one
who does not intend to resign himself to living in an
oubliette will succeed, in spite of everything, in
opening some chink that the light may shine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
through; and this light, when we have received it,
we hasten to share. It is forbidden, under the
severest penalties, including the capital, to introduce
newspapers into Belgium; it is forbidden, under the
same penalties, to publish and distribute "false
news," as our masters call it. It makes little
difference to us; not an article or book of importance
appears abroad but it reaches us, and two days later
it is secretly distributed in thousands of copies.
There will be a curious book for some one to write
when the war is over, on the subject of the strange
and ingenious means employed by the Belgians,
prisoners in their own country since August 1914,
to obtain and distribute prohibited letterpress.</p>

<p>There is accordingly no doubt that if the Germans
really wished it they could without great difficulty
obtain reliable "documentation." But they do not
wish it. They, of late so proud of their critical
spirit, who made it their rule, so they professed&mdash;and
their glory, as was thought&mdash;to accept only that
which their reason commanded them to believe!
They have abdicated their critical faculty; they
have sacrificed it to the militarist Moloch. And
to-day, with eyes closed, they swallow all that the
Government and its reptile Press presents to them.</p>


<p><i>The Abolition of Free Discussion in Germany.</i></p>

<p>What am I saying? Not only are they ready to
swallow all the lies offered to them; they have even
abolished liberty of speech among themselves. A
striking example of this fact was given by the
<i>N.R.C.</i> (of the 16th November, 1914, morning
edition). Dr. Wekberg, one of the three editors
of a German periodical, the <i xml:lang="de">Revue des Volksrechts</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
retired from his editorship because his colleagues
refused to insert an article in which he declared that
Germany's attitude towards Belgium was perhaps
disputable. It would be difficult to push intolerance
of criticism much farther.</p>

<p>In the same connection we may recall the sessions
of the Reichstag of the 4th August, 1914, the
2nd December, 1914, and the 20th March, 1915.
At the first session not a voice protested against the
war. At the second, the Socialist deputy, Dr.
Karl Liebknecht, asked leave to present some
objections, which indeed were timid enough; he
was at once disowned by his party. On the 20th
March the deputy Ledebour permitted himself to
criticize the proclamation of Marshal von Hindenburg,
prescribing the burning of three Russian villages for
any German village burned by the Russians. Both
these deputies expressed the opinion that it is
iniquitous to punish the innocent in the place of
the guilty. Immediately the whole assembly,
Socialists included, copiously abused and insulted
the two speakers. We may remark that Herr
Ledebour was discussing not a strategical measure,
but a prescription that was merely inhuman (see
<i>K.Z.</i>, 20th March, 1915, evening).</p>

<p>These few examples are enough to show that the
Socialists lend themselves to militarist domestication
with the same docility as the "bourgeois" parties.
As for the Catholic remnant in the Reichstag, its
docility surpasses even that of the Socialists.</p>

<p>In short, all the political parties, without exception,
have abdicated their liberty of thought, to accept,
obsequiously and without the slightest attempt
at discussion, the ready-made opinions provided by
authority. Such, in Germany, is the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
discipline, that all have submitted without protest&mdash;one
might almost say wantonly&mdash;to the voluntary
extirpation of the critical spirit. But the inevitable
results of this servility were not long in showing
themselves; having renounced the employment of
reason, the Germans now accept the most extravagant
lies.</p>


<p><i>German Credulity.</i></p>

<p>We have remarked that one day a curious book
may be written as to the expedients invented by the
Belgians to obtain news from abroad and to distribute
it throughout the country. Equally interesting&mdash;but
how discouraging, from the standpoint
of the progressive evolution of the human mind&mdash;will
be the book containing the amazing examples
of credulity afforded by the Germans during this
war. When speaking of the German accusations
against the Belgians we cited the case of the rifles
collected in the Hôtel de Ville, which were exhibited
to the German soldiers as the irrefutable proof of the
official premeditation of the "franc-tireur" campaign
(p. <a href="#Page_90">90</a> Not only were the soldiers thus
deluded. A well-known novelist, Herr Fedor von
Zobeltitz, visiting in Antwerp a museum of arms,
which contained war weapons of the Middle Ages,
cried: "See how Belgium made ready for the war!"
Was he sincere? It is difficult to say, for artists
often allow their sensibility to run away with them.
One may say the same of the Kaiser, who also
declared that Belgium had long been preparing for
the "war of <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"; and even, perhaps, of
Herr Bethmann-Hollweg, who spoke, in his manifesto
to the American newspapers, of gouged-out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
eyes and other atrocities whose falsity he could
very easily have ascertained.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">News published by the German Government.</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <i>10th September</i>.&mdash;The <i xml:lang="de">Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</i>
publishes the following telegram addressed by the Emperor to
President Wilson of the United States:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I consider it my duty, Mr. President, to inform you, in your
quality of a most distinguished representative of humanitarian
principles, of the fact that my troops discovered, after the capture
of the French fortress of Longwy, in that fortress, thousands of
dum-dum bullets made in special workshops by the Government.
Bullets of the same kind have been found on dead soldiers, or
wounded or prisoners, of English nationality. You know what
horrible wounds and sufferings are caused by these balls, and that
their employment is forbidden by the recognized principles of
international law. I therefore raise a solemn protest against
such a mode of making war, which has become, thanks to
the methods of our adversaries, one of the most barbarous of
history.</p>

<p>"Not only have they themselves employed this cruel weapon,
but the Belgian Government has openly encouraged the civil
population to take part in this war, which it had carefully for a
long time prepared. The cruelties inflicted, in the course of this
guerilla war, by women and even by priests, upon wounded
soldiers, doctors, and hospital nurses (doctors have been killed
and hospitals fired on) have been such that my generals have
finally found themselves obliged to resort to the most rigorous
means to chastise the guilty and to prevent the bloodthirsty population
from continuing these abominable, criminal, and hateful
acts. Many villages, and even the city of Louvain, have had to
be demolished (except the very beautiful Hôtel de Ville) in the
interest of our defence and the protection of our troops. My
heart bleeds when I see that such measures have been rendered
inevitable, and when I think of the innumerable innocent persons
who have lost their homes and their belongings as a result of the
deeds of the criminals in question.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We will suppose, for the time being&mdash;to be
extremely generous to the Kaiser and his Chancellor&mdash;that
they accepted, in good faith, the accusations
of cruelty brought against the Belgians, and that
they carefully refrained from investigating them, so
that they should not be forced to recognize their
imbecility.</p>


<p><i>Voluntary Blindness of the "Intellectual.</i>"</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be objected that the examples
hitherto cited emanate chiefly from politicians and
literary men, who are not accustomed to exercise
their judgment. But there are also the manifestoes
of the professorial body, that is, those whose essential
mission consists in passing facts and ideas
through the sieve of criticism, to isolate the true
from the false, and to extract from error the fragment
of truth which may have fallen into it. For what
is the effect of teaching, of whatever degree, if it is
not the constant alertness of the critical spirit, which
seeks, in all things and at every moment, to separate
that which is true and which should therefore be
communicated to the disciple from the medley of
false and useless things which may with impunity
be abandoned to oblivion? And when the teacher
is also a seeker, has he not once more unceasingly to
exercise his critical spirit, that he may recognize in
the host of ideas which present themselves to him
those which may lead him to the desired end&mdash;and,
once this is attained, those which he may use as a
touchstone to test experimentally the validity of
these deductions? In short, for the professor and
the scientific worker there is no intellectual faculty
more indispensable than the critical spirit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>
<p>Now among those who have dashed into the lists
to champion, with their pens, the rights of Germany,
and to crush her adversaries, we must make a quite
special mention of the professors and schoolmasters.
Let us begin with the latter. Their principal argument
in denial of the barbarous conduct of which the
German troops have been accused, is that it would
be incompatible with the flourishing condition of the
educational institutions of Germany. As though
elementary education was capable of eliminating
from humanity the profound imprints of its intimate
mentality! Instruction may hide them, as under a
veneer, but it can never cause their disappearance.</p>

<p>The Germans, after Sadowa and the war of
1870-1, declared that the whole honour of their
victories was due to their primary education. "The
French campaign is the triumph of the German
schoolmaster." Those who in Belgium have seen
the villages devastated by fire and the graves of the
civilians shot, and above all the pillaged homes, with
furniture and crockery broken into small fragments,
and the filthy beds, will carry away the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
that "the Belgian campaign is the bankruptcy of
the German schoolmaster."</p>


<p><i>The Manifesto of the "Ninety-three."</i></p>

<p>The famous manifesto of the "ninety-three Intellectuals"
to the civilized world is only too well
known, and has already been so universally execrated,
that there is no need to discuss it at length. The
reading of this document, which ought to be carefully
preserved for the edification of future generations,
might almost make us doubt the sanity of the
signatories. How could they have imagined that
"the civilized world" would accept their affirmations
and their denials? Both are equally devoid of
proof. To cite only one proposition&mdash;what are we
to think of the amazing declaration that not a single
Belgian citizen has lost his life or his property&mdash;except
in the case of the bitterest necessity? Have
they never seen the train-loads of "war-booty"
entering Germany? It would certainly be interesting
to hear them explain what is the "bitter necessity,"
under whose empire pianos and pictures have to be
carried off from Belgium, or that which compels the
Germans to force the collecting-boxes in the churches,
or that which made them shoot Father Dupierreux
for writing in his diary impressions unfavourable to
the Germans!</p>

<p>It would be cruel to insist. The "Ninety-three"
have already earned, as the first penalty of their
evil action, the disgust of the whole world. Further
dissection of their libel inevitably leads us to the
conclusion that the signatories display therein either
their lack of intelligence or their servility; and
that their only plausible excuse is that they allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
themselves to be carried away by their German pride,
the most incommensurable, intolerant, and insupportable
which the world has ever known. We will
confine ourselves to referring the reader to the
principal replies which were made to the manifesto
of the "Ninety-three." They are those of M. Seippel,
Mr. Church, the Portuguese Academy of Sciences,
the French Academy of Inscriptions and Belles
Lettres, the French Academy of Medicine, the
French Universities, the Zoological Society of
France, the English "intellectuals," M. Ruyssen,
M. Vandervelde, and <i>Simplicissimus</i>.</p>

<p>There is yet one point to be mentioned. The
declaration of the German "intellectuals" was first
made known to us by an article in the <i xml:lang="de">Kriegs Echo</i>
of the 16th October, 1914, entitled <i xml:lang="de">Es ist Nicht Wahr</i>,
and giving the whole manifesto, excepting the
signatures and the paragraph referring to Louvain.
Well! when we had read this tissue of flagrant lies
we attributed it to some journalist who dared not
even sign his name to his lucubrations. And when,
later, we were told that the authors&mdash;or more
exactly the signatories&mdash;comprised some of the most
celebrated writers in Germany, we believed the
whole thing must be a hoax. But we had to admit
the evidence. It was for many of us a very painful
moment when our illusions as to the stability of
science in Germany were thus dispelled.</p>


<p><i>The Manifesto of the 3,125 Professors.</i></p>

<p>Did the Government consider that the representatives
of science and art were not yet sufficiently
compromised, and that they had not yet sufficiently
involved the fate of the Universities with that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Militarism? In any case, only a few days after the
publication of the manifesto of the "Ninety-three"
a fresh declaration appeared, devoted entirely to the
promotion of the solidarity of superior education with
the army, and signed by 3,125 names, or those of
almost all the professors of Germany.</p>

<p>The mentality of the masters pales before that
of the disciples. The Brussels correspondent of the
<i>N.R.C.</i> relates (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 11th November, 1914,
morning), that of the innumerable soldiers whom
he has seen passing, the only ones whose attitude
was insolent were young university students of
Berlin. Moreover, the German Socialists who visited
our <i xml:lang="fr">Maison du Peuple</i> avowed that the troops who
burned Louvain were principally composed of
"intellectuals"!</p>

<p>Besides the intellectuals of the teaching profession
and the arts, those "barbarian scholars," as M. Emile
Boutroux calls them, there is another category,
which has likewise been mobilized to defend the
militarist spirit and the Hohenzollern dynasty. This
is the clergy: Protestant pastors, Catholic priests,
Israelitish rabbis; all without distinction have been
touched by the militarist grace and have entered the
campaign for the good cause.</p>


<p><i>The Protestant Pastors.</i></p>

<p>Honour where honour is due! Herr O. Dryander,
first preacher to the Court of Berlin, published a
collective letter, drafted by himself, Herr Lahusen,
and Herr Axenfeld, in reply to M. Babut's appeal for
a declaration from the Christians of the belligerent
countries, demanding that the war should be conducted
conformably with Christian principles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the laws of humanity.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Herr Dryander and his
acolytes refuse to entertain the idea that "a step
of this nature could be necessary in Germany in
order that the war shall be conducted conformably
with Christian ideas and the claims of the most
elementary humanity." Without cross-examination,
without any sort of discussion, they adopt the accusations
made against the armies of the Allies, and they
deny the actions of which the Germans are accused.
This is, as will be seen, the same method as that of
the German Freemasons in an analogous case. Then
they naturally sing the old refrain: "The war has
been forced upon Germany" (they do not say "by
Belgium"). In short, there is no need to throw any
light on the subject, as there is already light within
their minds, and the German mind is of course the
only mind one must take into account.</p>

<p>The same theologian has published several pamphlets
of sermons; <i xml:lang="de">Evangelische Reden in Schwerer
Zeit</i>. The general theme remains the same. "We
have been compelled to accept war" (1, p. 5); "We
are fighting for our <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i> against the absence of
<i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>&mdash;for German morality against barbarism&mdash;for
the free German personality, attached to God, against
the instincts of the disorderly masses" (1, p. 7). "If
God be for us, who can be against us?"<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> "Now if
ever there was a just cause assuredly it is ours"
(1, p. 9). "War is a duty only when it is undertaken
for legitimate defence.... Let us thank God
that in the present war our state of legitimate
defence is so secure and so evident, and that it is
almost every day stayed up by fresh proofs; also we
have unshakable confidence in our right and in the
purity of our conscience" (2, pp. 38-9).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is a sermon of a somewhat peculiar kind.
Herr Busch, having explained that Germany is like
a peaceful stroller who suddenly finds himself attacked
by two assassins, and then by a third (p. 5),
declares that "in spite of all the German soldiers
love their enemies." "God be thanked," he says,
"we have already read of most touching examples in
the newspapers. A German sergeant-major, who had
been obliged to have a man and woman shot, in
Belgium, after a council of war, adopted their only
child, a little girl of two or three years; for he was
himself without children; as his regiment soon
afterwards left for Eastern Prussia, and was passing
through his own town, he took the child to give it
to his wife" (p. 9). Pray God&mdash;we might add, whose
civilization is only Belgian&mdash;that there are not too
many married men without children among the
soldiers of the Kaiser, for they have a way of making
orphans in order to adopt them which would cost our
country dear.</p>

<p>Herr Correvon, pastor of the Reformed Church
(French-speaking) in Frankfort-on-Main, preached
a sermon on the 9th August, 1914, on the text:
"If God be for us, who can be against us?" His
arguments amount to this: Germany, having the
right on her side, will have God on her side also.
He naturally speaks of "the firm and admirable
speech of the Chancellor, a man whom I can only
compare with a Duplessis-Mornay, the minister of
Henri IV" (p. 11). Then, having summarized the
Emperor's speech, he cried: "To solve the alarming
problem of these social questions ... it needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
only the potent gesture with which the God who is
always the strong city, the '<i xml:lang="de">feste Burg</i>' of Germany,
the God of Luther, the God of Paul Gerhard and
Sebastian Bach, has pronounced the terrible and
perhaps the liberating word: 'You wish for war, you
shall have it'!"</p>

<p>We see that from the very first days of the war,
before any one could have verified the statements of
the Chancellor, the Protestant pastors of Germany,
even those of foreign origin, unhesitatingly accepted
the official assertions. Is it as pastors that they
stand forth as the stern defenders of the rights of
truth? Are they not rather spiritless courtiers, we
might almost say like the sheep of Panurge?</p>


<p><i>The Catholic Priests and Rabbis.</i></p>

<p>The Catholic priests have given proofs of equal
docility. Mgr. the Cardinal Felix von Hartmann,
Archbishop of Cologne, says in <i>The Divine Providence</i>,
a pastoral letter read on the 25th of January,
1915:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our warriors have gone forth to the bloody conflict, with God,
for King and Country! With God, in the conflict which has
been forced upon us, the fight for the salvation and the liberty
of our dear German land; with God, in the war for the sacred
possessions of Christianity and its beneficent civilization. And
what exploits have not our warriors accomplished, under the
protection of God, under the leadership of their wonderful chiefs,
the Emperor and the German Princes, exploits whose glory shall
shine in times to come! And more, what precious treasures of
devotion, of love for one's neighbour, and of nobility, has not
this war revealed, in our country as on the field of battle!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The curate August Ritzl, however, falls into the
sin of pride.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Kultur has received an unheard-of impulse in Germany;
the human spirit has subjected the most diverse forces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
nature.... A glance at the map shows us the German Empire
as the centre of Europe. On all sides, near and far, enemies
are intent on the ruin of our country. To the east the giant
empire of Russia threatens us&mdash;to the west, violent France, still
strong despite her moral decay&mdash;allied with English perfidy
and Belgian cruelty; Japan, Serbia, and Egypt have also
declared war upon us" (pp. 26-27).</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, reverend sir, before proclaiming the cruelty
of the Belgians, before asserting, from the vantage
of the pulpit of Truth, that Serbia and Egypt have
declared war on Germany, a little circumspection
and critical sense would not have been out of place!</p>

<p>Let us also cite the sermon preached on the 9th
August, in the synagogue of Schwerin, by Dr. S.
Silberstein, rabbi of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
"They have forced us to put our
hand to the sword; we execrate the perfidy with
which our enemies are fighting us; we wish to ward
off the danger that threatens us in honourable combat."
So the Jewish rabbis knew as early as the 9th
August that it was Germany that had been attacked,
and that the other nations were forgers!</p>

<p>Useless to prolong the series.... We should be
only repeating ourselves; for all the preachers, of
whatever confession, repeat the same lesson, almost
in the same words: "The war which has been forced
upon us ... our treacherous enemies ... our loyal
allies ... the cruel Belgians ... our excellent
soldiers, allying goodness to bravery ... our heroic
leaders...."</p>


<h3>B.&mdash;Untruthfulness.</h3>

<p>To describe frankly and completely the attitude of
the Germans in Belgium during the present war,
without speaking of their duplicity, would be an
impossible task; so that the reader must not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
surprised that on every page of our record we have
pinned down at least one lie. We must not forget
that modern Germany follows the examples of Bismarck,
and that Bismarck himself proclaimed that
he had caused the outbreak of the war of 1870 by
a skilful falsification of a Government despatch.
At the time of the centenary of the Iron Chancellor's
birth&mdash;the 1st April, 1915&mdash;the German
newspapers gave their lyric enthusiasm a loose rein;
but none of the endless dithyrambics consecrated to
the glorification of the Great Man contained a single
word of blame for the forgery itself&mdash;abominable as
it was&mdash;nor for the ostentatious impudence with
which its author confessed it.</p>

<p>What honesty can we expect in a people which
praises to the skies a forger because he was a forger,
and a forger proud of his skill!</p>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">A Few Lies.</span></h3>

<p>Number 50 of <i xml:lang="de">Die Wochenschau</i> (1914, p. 1588)
contains a photograph in which we see sailors
loading a gun installed among sand-hills. The
inscription underneath (translated from the German)
reads: "Belgian gun, captured and served by
German sailors on the coast of the Channel."
The Channel! The Germans have never been
there: they did set out, full of enthusiasm, for
Calais, and then the shore of the Channel, and
then London. But in that direction they never
got farther than Lombartzyde, on the right bank
of the Yser. But they prefer to let it be believed
that they command the Channel, so they have
chosen the Channel coast for the site of their gun&mdash;on
paper. Then this "Belgian gun" is of a
curious type for a piece of Belgian artillery; our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
guns have a rectangular shield, while the shield of
the German guns is round&mdash;just like that in the
photograph! Finally, one may ask what the
gunners are aiming at on this seashore, with
their small gun? Certainly not one of the English
vessels bombarding the Belgian coast, for these lie
much too far out to sea; perhaps the Germans are
amusing themselves by firing shells at the shrimpers,
to repeat their memorable exploit of the 8th September,
1914? Well, that makes three flagrant lies
to one single photograph!</p>

<p>Number 15 of <i xml:lang="de">Die Wochenschau</i> (1915) gives on
page 463 a view of the interior of the Palais de
Justice in Brussels. Here is the description&mdash;a
French translation is given: "German soldiers in
the hall of the Assize Court in the Palais de Justice
of Brussels. Brussels having become the seat of the
German General Government for Belgium, has naturally
a strong garrison and a very animated military life.
The famous Palais de Justice on the Place Poelaert
also houses a great number of soldiers. Nothing is
more singular than the picture presented by this
imposing and luxurious building with the new
inmates in 'campaigning grey' who are installed
there. A thousand precautions are taken so that
nothing shall be spoiled; and while wherever the
enemy has trodden on German soil it will be necessary
to work for a long time rebuilding the buildings
he has destroyed, no one will perceive, who sees the
superb halls of the Palais de Justice in Brussels,
that the German soldiers are billeted there."</p>

<p>To understand the full beauty of this pleasantry
one has only to look at the picture. One sees there
the linen which these soldiers are drying on clotheslines
stretched across the "luxurious hall"; this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
apparently, is one of the "thousand precautions"
taken in order that nothing may be spoiled.</p>

<p>It was desired to prove that England had already
been forced to send marines into France. No. 27
of the <i xml:lang="de">Illustrierte Kriegs-Kurier</i>, a semi-official,
subsidized organ, represents "President Poincaré
visiting the British forces in France. One sees
him reviewing the artillery of the Royal Marines."
And we do see President Poincaré passing in front
of two ranks of British soldiers armed with rifles.
But was it in France that this review took place,
during the present war? Consult the July number
of the French illustrated periodical, <i xml:lang="fr">Lectures pour
tous</i>, for 1913. On page 1245 you will find a photograph
entitled "The Consecration of the Entente
Cordiale. M. Poincaré, accompanied by the Prince
of Wales, reviewing his guard of honour on his
arrival at Portsmouth (24th June, 1913)." Now
the same personages and the same soldiers figure
in the two photographs; and the surroundings are
the same. The only difference is that one photograph
was taken a moment later than the other.</p>

<p>It seems that trickery of this kind is believed not
to be a German speciality. Our neighbours accuse
the Russians and the English of the same fault.
But a kind of lie of which Germany may boldly
claim the paternity and the exclusive monopoly is
that which consists in denying, or at least in considerably
diminishing, the extent of their acts of
vandalism. On the other hand, they try to deceive
their readers as to the causes of the destruction of
Belgian towns.</p>

<p>Thus they are now trying to make people believe
that Louvain was not intentionally burned, but
that the town suffered a bombardment. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the legend which they related to Dr. Sven Hedin,
while calling his attention to the accuracy of their
fire:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Eleven miles to Louvain. Once in the town one goes a good
way before coming to the first ruins. By no means all Louvain
has been destroyed by the bombardment, as is imagined. Hardly
a fifth of the town is destroyed. It is true that this fifth included
many precious buildings, which cannot be replaced; particularly
regrettable is the loss of the library. In the midst of this destruction,
however, like a rock in the midst of the sea, rises the Hôtel
de Ville, the proud jewel of the period of 1450, with its six
slender open towers. I went right round the Hôtel de Ville, and
I could not with the best will in the world discover a scratch
on these walls, with their prodigal richness of ornamentation.
Perhaps there may somewhere be a scratch from a shell-splinter
which escaped my eyes. Thanks to the excellence of the German
fire not a single moulding of the six towers has been damaged.
The reason for the bombardment of Louvain is known. The
civil population fired from the windows on the German troops
at the time of their entering the town, and as this crime could
not be punished otherwise, the houses were burned by bombardment.
When the German soldiers sought to extinguish the
flames in the houses adjacent to the Hôtel de Ville the <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>
again fired on them with their carbines. <i>Any other army
in the world would have done the same</i>, and the Germans have
themselves profoundly regretted that they were forced against
their will to resort to such means."</p>

<div class="right">
(<span class="smcap">Sven Hedin</span>, <i xml:lang="de">Ein Volk in Waffen</i>, p. 149.)<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>They told the same story at Termonde to Herren
Koester and Noske: "It is certain," say these
gentlemen, "that Termonde was not intentionally
burned."</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Germans try to dissemble
the extent of the damage inflicted. In the October
issue of the official and propagandist <i xml:lang="fr">Journal de la
Guerre</i> they give a plan of Louvain on which the
parts destroyed are shown by shading. Now this
plan is falsified in two ways. In the first place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
no distinction is made between the portion built
on and that occupied by market gardeners, which
is considerable; so that the ratio of the part
destroyed to the part left intact is distorted.
Secondly, this portion is absolutely diminished;
many quarters burned are shown as intact; to
mention only one example, the Old Market, where
only the College of the Josephites and a few
adjacent houses have been left standing, is marked
as untouched by fire.</p>

<p>There is yet another kind of graphic lie which is
peculiar to the Germans. They are experts at displaying
sentimentality to order; a sentimentality,
by the way, which goes ill with their incontestable
cruelty. Thus they have several times published
photographs representing German soldiers sharing
their bread or soup with French and Belgian women
or children. One is particularly inclined to let oneself
be touched by the kindliness of these German
warriors, who, after having been so treacherously
attacked by the terrible "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>," now take
the bread from their own mouths to feed the starving
population.... What these public demonstrations
of German generosity and magnanimity are worth
one may judge from the photograph published in
No. 16 of the <i xml:lang="de">Illustrierte Kriegs-Kurier</i>. (It is
interesting to note that it is always the <i xml:lang="de">Kurier</i>,
semi-official and subsidized, which bears the palm
for sincerity.) The illustration shows that "the
soldiers of the German Landsturm share their
bread with French children." Now, this little
scene, otherwise very convincing, is not laid in
France but in Belgium, in the railway station at
Buysinghen, near Hal. It is wholly "faked."</p>

<p>This is not the only instance in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Germans have built up scenes to be photographed
or cinematographed. Here is another. On the
20th October, 1914, a military band had been
playing on the terrace of the Botanical Gardens of
Brussels, and some German officers were strolling
round the musicians. At the same time a cinematographic
camera was set up in the Rue Royale. It
was naturally hoped that large numbers of the public
would gather near the band, so that a nice film
could be obtained, showing a crowd of Belgian
citizens present at a military concert, and fraternizing
with the German officers. Alas, the Germans
had counted without the hatred which the people of
Brussels entertain for anything which concerns our
oppressors! At the first thumps of the big drum the
promenaders rapidly melted away, and the disappointed
officers were left alone. The scheme had
failed! A fresh attempt was made on the 26th, on
the Boulevard Anspach, near the Bourse; that is,
at the busiest spot in Brussels. The number of
passers-by there is always so great that it is easy to
give the impression of a crowd. Yet those who had
occasion to preside over the unwinding of the film
discovered that not a few people were ostentatiously
turning their backs upon the musicians. This, by
the way, is the favourite attitude of the people of
Brussels when, at about eleven o'clock each morning,
the military band&mdash;a true barbarian orchestra&mdash;passes
down the Rue Royale and along the Park.</p>

<p>No. 31 of this semi-official journal shows "the
band of the German Marines which plays every
Sunday at Zeebrugge." Now a street like that
represented, with tall contiguous houses and large
shops, does not exist in Zeebrugge.</p>

<p>No. 3 of the same paper (it must certainly justify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the Government subsidy) shows us, in these photographs,
the entry of the German Marines into
Antwerp. Only the photographs were taken in
Brussels, at the corner of the Rue de la Loi and
the Rue Ducale.</p>

<p>The same number contains two photographs of the
Hôtel de Ville, Louvain: "Before and after the
Bombardment"(!)</p>

<p>Naturally our Washingtonian enemies do not miss
their opportunities of falsifying picture postcards.
In January 1915 they were selling in Belgium a
card entitled <i xml:lang="de">Kriegsoperationskarte als Feld-Postbrief</i>
(published by Forkel, Stuttgart), according to
which they were occupying, in Flanders, a region
considerably to the west of the Yser; their front
reaching to Oost-Dunkerke and Poperinghe. Another
card, showing the country round Verdun, is even
more flagrantly untruthful.</p>


<p><i>Written Lies.</i></p>

<p>Let us pass on to the written lies.</p>

<p>The reader will remember the innumerable lies
told by the German Press respecting the attitude of
the Belgian population toward the German residents
in our towns (p. <a href="#Page_106">106</a>), the German wounded (p. <a href="#Page_99">99</a>),
and the German troops passing through or billeted in
them. We shall not return to these again, save
to refer to other inventions which the Germans
employed to excite their troops against ours.</p>

<p>Not content with accusing us of the most unspeakable
crimes against their army, the Germans
have even accused us of odious crimes against our
own countrymen. In this way they seek to prove
the bestially ferocious character of the Belgians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>In the booklet entitled <i xml:lang="de">Sturmnacht in Loewen</i> (A
Night of Alarm in Louvain) Herr Robert Heymann,
after reminding his readers of the cruelties of which
the Belgians were guilty in Antwerp, Brussels, etc.,
adds that these savage deeds were by no means
surprising on the part of a people which does not
even respect its own fellow-citizens. Then (p. 8)
he relates the "Brutalities committed against a
Convent." This is too interesting an effort to suffer
a word of suppression.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Brutal Attack on a Convent.</span></div>

<p>Let us hear one of those concerned relate his tribulations.
The story constitutes an important document, testifying to the
high level of Germany as regards morality and <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>:
Germany, who has something better to do in this war than
to commit any bloodthirsty action.</p>

<p>A great mission has fallen to Germany, and the day is no
longer distant when all the neutral nations will realize this.</p>

<p>This is the "story of the Brothers of Silence."</p>

<p>The convent of the Jesuits is situated quite close to Liége,
on a hill about 600 yards from the southern fort (<i>a</i>). I had
been a brother of the convent for two years. We brothers do
not read the newspapers, and by reason of our vow of silence (<i>b</i>)
we do not speak either, so that we knew nothing about the war.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 6th August, I, simultaneously with seven other
brothers, took the watch from noon to midnight. In the night, at
11.15, I suddenly heard a sound completely unknown to me. I
went out into the courtyard, whence, to one side, I could see Liége
and its forts. I saw, at some distance, in the sky, a little light;
this told me that the thing was in the air. I intended to pursue
my rounds, but the snoring sound which was approaching,
although the life of the world has no interest for me, made me
halt. The light came nearer and nearer; the noise had ceased.
The idea occurred to me that this might be a dirigible; but no,
all of a sudden a blinding light illumined the earth. It is the
star of the Magi, announcing something, I thought; I will follow
it with my eyes. In the radiance down below I saw everything
plainly&mdash;portions of the fortress and other things. Then, lit up
by reflection from the illuminated earth, I saw that there really
was a powerful dirigible there (<i>c</i>). I felt inclined to shout for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
joy; I had never yet seen a dirigible. The light lasted only a few
seconds, but to me it seemed a long time. My eyes were not yet
accustomed to the darkness of the night, when I heard a crash.
I looked up to the sky; I saw nothing; the little light was quietly
moving away; but down below there was plenty to see&mdash;fire, and
smoke! In the light I could easily see everything. I also heard
the echo. I had not had time to recover from my great alarm
when a second light appeared on the earth, rather close to me.
This time I could see still more clearly that it was a dirigible. It
seemed to me that at the end of a long cable was suspended, very
low down, a metal car, in which stood a man. I saw him
distinctly with his two hands throwing an object into the
illumined part. Immediately afterwards the light on the
ground disappeared. I continued, however, to gaze at the same
spot. A mighty sheaf of fire gushed up, while great blocks were
thrown into the air on every side. What a terrible crash! My
ear-drums seemed broken; I was as though deaf. The earth
trembled so violently underfoot that I staggered. Greatly alarmed,
I still watched the same place. The blinding sheaf of fire had
turned into a dense mass of smoke, which was rising slowly into
the air. Little by little it grew lighter, like a white vapour.
Finally the vicinity lit up as though on fire.</p>

<p>I tried to note whether the fire was spreading, when I was
shaken by a fresh crash. This terrible spectacle repeated itself
continually, but was gradually moving away. From 11.15 to
midnight 12 bombs were thrown on the forts. In the interval
of the explosions one heard the snoring of the motors. After the
last explosion the dirigible rose, moved off, and disappeared. I
remained with my eyes fixed in the same direction; the clock of
the convent struck midnight.</p>

<p>The seven brothers who had been keeping the watch and
I myself remained in the courtyard with those who came to
relieve us. No one could think of sleep. The other brothers
and the fathers (we were 500) remained indoors, watching the
burning fortress from the windows.</p>

<p>As I was no longer on guard I went to seek a ladder, and in
order to see better I climbed a wall situated a little farther down,
and some 10 feet high. I remained there until four o'clock. About
two o'clock there began, down below in the city, a sound of isolated
rifle-shots, and shouts which soon grew louder and louder.</p>

<p>At last an infernal uproar reached my ears, and numerous fires
broke out in that part of the city neighbouring on the convent.</p>

<p>At four o'clock the bell called us to the church. It was an extraordinary
thing: despite our alarm we all remained obedient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
our vow of silence. We must not speak! But it became a real
torment, for our devotions lasted for two long hours.</p>

<p>By the shock of the explosions the beautiful stained-glass
windows were bent inwards like sails swollen by the wind. The
walls of stone, nearly 3 feet in thickness, which surrounded the
courtyard, showed long, deep fissures. When at 6 a.m. we left
the church the shots and the shouting were still more terrible,
and the fires more numerous and farther towards the interior of
the town.</p>

<p>As usual, the porter opened the gate at six. How alarming!
Hundreds of Belgians from the neighbourhood rushed into the
courtyard. As we feared the convent might be sacked (<i>f</i>),
the porter attempted at first to drive them back. A brother
said: "Go! you shall have all you want!" The misguided
populace immediately seized knives and killed 20 of our brothers
and one father. I myself rushed to the bell in the courtyard
and rang the alarm. Armed with pitchforks and manure-forks
and spades (<i>g</i>), the brothers rushed into the courtyard and
drove out the mob. Two brothers, who during the fight were
carried away in the crowd, were discovered hacked to pieces,
mangled as though by wild beasts. Their bodies were a dreadful
sight. A Belgian brother, hearing the alarm, seized a fork, and
so armed he rushed towards the gate, thinking to fight German
soldiers. When he saw that his assailants were his compatriots
he turned his arms against us, his brothers, shouting like a
madman: "You are mad, you are mad!" After a brief struggle
the fork was torn away from him. He was seized and thrown
over the wall. He had turned his arms against his brothers; but
above all he had broken his vow of silence.</p>

<p>The fight had lasted barely a quarter of an hour. After the
gate was closed&mdash;at 6.15, our usual breakfast hour&mdash;we assembled
in the refectory for our meal.</p>

<p>Despite these extraordinary events I was extremely hungry.
We now felt safe. But when, after the twenty minutes which
our meal lasted, we returned to the courtyard, we saw that
the Belgian brutes had in two places set fire to the convent.
They had dragged our corn and hay under the wood-shed which
stood not far from the convent; they had also pushed carts loaded
with corn in the shock against the buildings and outhouses (<i>g</i>), and
had set fire to the whole. The flames were already reaching the
gable. It was no use dreaming of saving anything, for all the
buildings were connected with one another. This was a sore
trial. But it could not break our vow of silence, and, doubly
mute, we watched the flames. Our sorrow found vent in tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
when we saw our Superior burst into sobs. He came into our
midst; as all the fathers may speak, he said aloud: "Go and
save what you can!" and we carried out his orders.</p>

<p>Rapidly we telephoned to the Belgian authorities at Liége to
obtain help and protection. But to our great alarm <i>German
soldiers</i> appeared at this moment. As Germany does not allow
us Jesuits within her frontiers, we were extremely anxious. On
account of the presence of the German troops we wanted to carry
back into the convent the precious treasures already brought into
the court; but the leader of the German troops explained to our
Superior that this portion of Liége was already in the hands of the
Germans. We therefore placed ourselves under their protection.
We had no reason to regret it. The German escort came with
eight automobiles, which bore our inestimable treasures into
Germany; paintings, which in our haste we cut from their frames
and rolled like paper; our sacred golden vessels, and our fathers (<i>h</i>).
In great haste we had dug a huge ditch, in which, without religious
ceremony and without words, we buried our 20 assassinated
brothers and the father who was killed. While the fire
continued to burn the hundreds of brothers remaining ran hither
and thither in unspeakable disorder, seeking their clothes and
shoes. I had wooden shoes on and could not find shoes to fit
me; but I saw, to my great amazement, four pairs of shoes in
my box. Everything was stuffed into the boxes and forced down
with the feet, in all haste.</p>

<p>So, on Saturday (<i>i</i>), at dawn, 350 brothers left the still smoking
convent to cross the German frontier. For three hours each
painfully dragged along what modest belongings he had saved.
One old brother of eighty years remained behind; he declared,
when abandoned: "I wish to die here." Although the German
soldiers protected us as we proceeded, the Belgian people still
attacked us frequently. I received violent kicks, blows on the
legs, and all over my body. For two nights none of us slept, and
in addition we were greatly perturbed and in terrible trouble.</p>

<p>When, after unheard-of exertions, we dragged ourselves across
the frontier, we let ourselves fall exhausted in a meadow, where
we slept, a leaden slumber, protected and watched by the
Germans, from morning to sunset.</p>

</div></blockquote>

<p>As will be seen, this is a story to make the flesh
creep. Still, it seems to us to present certain
difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) There is no convent of Jesuits near Liége
about 600 yards from one of the southern forts
(Boncelles, Embourg, and Chaudfontaine).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Jesuit brothers are <i>not</i> compelled to keep
silence. No doubt the author chose the Jesuits
because the order is excluded from Germany, so that
he would expect his compatriots to know nothing of
the rule of the Jesuit communities.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) How did these brothers, who read no newspapers
and never spoke, know of the existence of
dirigibles?</p>

<p>But apart from all this, the facts are incorrect.
At no time did a dirigible fly over Liége during the
siege.</p>

<p>The people of Liége saw a German dirigible for the
first time on the 1st September, 1914, at 10 p.m.
On the following day, at 6 p.m., they saw another.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Therefore fires could not have been lit by the
bombs from these dirigibles.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Where have stained-glass windows ever been
seen to bulge like sails under the shock of an
explosion capable of cracking walls over 30 inches
in thickness?</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Nothing had happened so far to give any one
the idea that the convent was about to be pillaged.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Since when have the Jesuit convents owned
farms, etc., or been equipped with hay-forks,
manure-forks, spades, hay-carts, etc.?</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) It is delightful to note that in enumerating
the precious possessions of the convent the Jesuit
fathers occupy the very last place, after the pictures
and the gold plate! But this impertinence is more
apparent than real; for the narrator has just stated
that the 150 Jesuit fathers were packed, together
with the pictures and the sacred vessels, in <i>eight</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
motor-cars! Evidently they were very tiny Jesuits.
It must have been their minuteness that saved them;
for the author has reminded us that Jesuits (of
ordinary size) are not admitted into Germany; but
these, happily, passed unperceived.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) It was not Saturday, but Friday.</p>

<p>It is by such inventions&mdash;presented as the narratives
of eye-witnesses, and not as romances&mdash;that the
Germans excite against us both their troops and their
home population. The method has given excellent
results; nothing gives better proof of its efficiency
than the first paragraph of the story of <i>The Battle of
Charleroi</i>, in which we read that at the beginning of
August many trucks passed through Belgium which
bore the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<i xml:lang="de">Gegen Frankreich mit Mut,<br />
Gegen Belgiën mit Wut.</i><br />
(Against France with courage; against Belgium with rage.)
</div>

<p>Which shows to what a pitch the minds of the
German troops had been excited against us.</p>


<p><i>A "French Dirigible" Captured by the Germans.</i></p>

<p>Other inscriptions on the railway carriages and
vans are not uninteresting to the student of <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>.</p>

<p>On the 5th March, 1915, we learned from ocular
witnesses that a German dirigible was lost, on the
4th, at Overhespen, near Tirlemont. <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique</i> of
the 6th March contained a few details.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, <i>5th March</i> (Official).&mdash;The Zeppelin dirigible L8,
returning yesterday from a fruitful voyage of exploration, came to
earth in the darkness near Tirlemont, and, during the process of
landing, struck against some trees. It was rather seriously
damaged, so that it seemed preferable to dismantle it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
operation was completed very rapidly by the soldiers of the
aviation department of Brussels, who were despatched to the
spot. The dismantled parts will be transported to Germany,
there to be rebuilt.</p></blockquote>

<p>In reality the "rather serious damage" meant that
the balloon was completely destroyed, and that twenty
of the twenty-eight occupants of the cars were killed.
So far we would not describe the report as a lie, as it
does not exceed the habitual limits of our enemies'
official telegrams. But this goes a little too far:
At Tirlemont the report was spread that the dirigible
in question was French, and that it was skilfully
captured by German troops; and on the trucks which
bore the metallic remains of the Zeppelin to Germany
was written, in large letters: <i xml:lang="de">Erobertes Französisches
Luftschiff</i> (Captured French Airship). This is no
longer a manipulated truth, but a downright lie.</p>


<p><i>The Transportation of the German Dead.</i></p>

<p>Here is another fraud of the same kind. When
the number of the German dead is too great for burial
on the field of battle they evacuate the surplus into
other districts. The bodies are usually transported
in closed vans. But sometimes these are lacking,
and the bodies have to be packed into goods
wagons. Nothing outside indicates the contents
of these wagons; it may be supposed that the
authorities have no desire to publish the extent of
their losses. For this reason the corpses are always
hidden under something else; one sees passing, for
example, what appears to be a trainload of sugar-beet,
but in reality the bodies of soldiers are being
transported. A biologist might call this an interesting
case of protective mimicry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Some Lying Placards.</i></p>

<p>The German authorities have no scruples about
posting up false news. For several weeks one might
read, on the walls of the Hôtel de Ville at Vilvorde,
the following placard:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Notice.</span></div>

<p>Antwerp surrendered to-day with its army.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">The District Commandant.</span><br />
(Signature illegible.)<br />
</div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Vilvorde</span>, <i>9th October, 1914</i>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>With its army! When the Germans were all
crestfallen at having laid hands on an empty nest!</p>

<p>This is merely grotesque; but here are three
placards which belong to the system of intimidation
<i xml:lang="fr">à outrance</i>.</p>

<p>We have already stated (p. <a href="#Page_147">147</a>) that placards
exhibited in Louvain stated that the town of Mons
was forced to pay a fine because a civilian had fired
on the German army. Now the fact was wholly
imaginary; never did any civilian of Mons fire on
the Germans; never did they accuse one of having
done so; so that they never had occasion to fine the
town on that account. All is false here, from the
first word to the last.</p>

<p>While at Louvain they were posting up the placard
relating to Mons, they were exhibiting at Mons a
notice according to which certain inhabitants of
Soignies had fired on the German troops. This also
was a sheer falsehood. No such action was imputed
to any inhabitant of Soignies. At Charleroi they
advertised the statement that they had inflicted a
penalty on Anderlues for a similar offence. Here,
once more, both accusation and penalty were pure
inventions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is an equally untruthful placard. It was
posted up at Cugnon (Luxemburg) early in October,
1914, between the fall of the first forts at Antwerp
and the taking of the city. It announces the destruction
of the line of forts between Verdun and
Toul, and the march on Paris (a month after the
battle of the Marne!). Its principal interest lies in
the signature: the burgomaster did not know of the
placard until it was posted; the military authorities
had simply forged his name. This did not prevent
them from forcing the commune of Cugnon to pay
for the printing of these lies.</p>


<p><i>M. Max's Denial.</i></p>

<p>The most interesting example of lying by placard
is undoubtedly that which was revealed by the
burgomaster of Brussels. On the 30th August one
might read, on the walls of the capital, a notice in
which M. Max gave the lie to a placard posted at
Liége. This is it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">City of Brussels.</span></div>

<p>The German governor of the city of Liége, Lieutenant-General
von Kolewe, yesterday had the following notice exposed:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>To the Inhabitants of the City of Liége.</i></p>

<p>"The burgomaster of Brussels has informed the German commandant
that the French Government has declared to the Belgian
Government the impossibility of assisting it offensively in any
way, as it is itself forced to assume the defensive."</p>

<p><i>To this assertion I oppose the most positive denial.</i></p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">The Burgomaster</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Adolphe Max.</span><br />
</div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, <i>30th August, 1914</i>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Since their burgomaster declared the assertion to
be false, no doubt could remain in the minds of the
people of Brussels. But, curiously enough, beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
M. Max's placard there remained a German placard,
which had been posted two days earlier, and in which
it was stated:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On the 25th inst. the official French newspapers published a
communication from the French Government stating that the
French armies being forced to assume the defensive would no
longer be in a position to assist Belgium in the matter of a
military offensive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, <i>23rd August, 1914</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The only serious difference between the two texts
was that at Liége the burgomaster of Brussels
guaranteed the truth of the <i xml:lang="fr">communiqué</i>. So the
impression was given that it was Herr von Kolewe
who had the idea of bringing M. Max's name into
this ridiculous statement, in the hope of giving it
some weight. But no! Von Kolewe was innocent
of the forgery; it was the work of the German
General Staff, and was distributed by the Wolff
Agency, as we learned a little later. The Liége
<i xml:lang="fr">communiqué</i> is precisely the official German telegram
as published everywhere&mdash;for example, in
<i xml:lang="fr">Les Nouvelles</i>, "published by the authorization of
the German Military Authority," at Spa, on the
30th August, 1914; by the <i>N.R.C.</i>, on the
28th August; by the <i>K.Z.</i> (see <i xml:lang="de">Kriegs-Depeschen</i>,
p. 41); and by the <i xml:lang="de">Frankfurter Zeitung</i> (see <i xml:lang="de">Der
Grosse Krieg</i>, p. 172).</p>

<p>What, then, is the meaning of the first telegram
posted in Brussels&mdash;that of the 25th August, in
which no mention of the burgomaster occurs?
Simply this: the German Government was announcing
to the whole world an item of "news"
whose improbability required to be supported by the
word of an honest man, such as the burgomaster of
Brussels. A lie so gross and flagrant might be published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
at Liége, but not in Brussels itself. Unfortunately
the Germans had not succeeded in cutting
off communication between Liége and Brussels; on
the day after its appearance the Liége placard had
reached M. Max, and he was able to issue his
famous denial. The effect was tremendous. From
that moment the people of Brussels no longer
believed any "official news."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Did the Germans
make any attempt to reply to the denial? None:
why attempt the impossible? But they prohibited,
with their usual heaviness, the publication of any
placards, even by the municipality.</p>


<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Important Notice.</span></div>

<p>The publication of placards, unless they have received my
special permission, is strictly prohibited, those of the municipality
of the city being included.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i>Signed</i>) <span class="smcap">von Lüttwitz</span>, <i>General</i>.<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Translated into the vulgar tongue this means:
"When we Germans lie we do not wish attention
called to the fact."</p>


<p><i>How the Officers Lie to their Men.</i></p>

<p>Hitherto we have considered only those German
lies which were addressed to the Belgians. But
there are better lies than these: they lie to their
own troops. At the outset of the invasion of
Belgium the German soldiers were led to believe
that they were already in France, quite close to
Paris, even in October and November 1914. Germans
in cantonments near Roulers, in Flanders, believed
that they were only eight miles from Paris, and they
used to ask the correspondent of the <i xml:lang="nl">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche
Courant</i> to show them "a place they could
see the Eiffel Tower from." This, it may be said,
proves that in all armies there are soldiers of small
intelligence, even in the German Army. No: it
proves that in this latter army the officers lie with
method. You may judge. The soldiers tended in
the hospital of the Palais de Justice in Brussels used
to date their letters "Paris"; and it was by order
of their superior officers that they deceived their
families. The official journal, <i xml:lang="de">Deutsche Soldatenpost</i>,
in its issue for the 16th October, 1914, contains a
little poem entitled "Hindenburg," whose third
stanza commences:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem">
<i xml:lang="de">Vor Paris aber steht das deutsche Heer...</i><br />
(But the German host stands before Paris.)<br />
</div>

<p>This, be it noted, on the 16th October, more
than a month after the battle of the Marne. About
the same time a soldier in Antwerp learned from his
officers that if the German army had not yet entered
Paris it was merely to avoid the plague, which was
raging there (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 20th October, 1914, morning).</p>

<p>After that, who can doubt that systematic lying
forms part of the duties of an officer towards his
men?</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">Perseverance in Falsehood.</span></p>

<p>Nothing is left to chance in the campaign of lies
any more than in the military campaign proper.
The Great General Staff organizes everything with
the same care&mdash;the attacks of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>," the
benzine syringes, the pastilles of fulminating cotton
employed in the rapid starting of conflagrations&mdash;just
as it organizes the man&oelig;uvres of the Press intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to direct the mentality of the troops towards a policy
of pitiless repression.</p>

<p>They even try to educate (which means, to pervert
the minds of) the prisoners of war in their concentration
camps. Thus in No. 5 of <i xml:lang="fr">La Guerre</i>, a journal
especially intended for prisoners of war (published
the 10th March, 1915), a passage is reproduced from
the "Records of the War," by Houston Stewart
Chamberlain. Here is an extract: "Finally, one
should read the notices on the detestable attitude of
the civil population of Belgium, of both sexes, in the
present war: notices officially confirmed and attested
in writing by several priests: according to which the
populace, behaving a hundred times worse than
ferocious beasts, have horribly mutilated and gouged
out the eyes of poor wounded German soldiers, afterwards
slowly stifling them by pouring sawdust into
their nose and mouth."</p>

<p>It will perhaps be objected that those who write
of such things are blinded by the militarist spirit;
that they have, like everybody in Germany, abolished
in themselves the critical faculty; and that they do
not even dream of disputing the statements of the
official journals; in short, that they do not, properly
speaking, lie, because they are sincere. But can
they really be sincere? Could they, on the 10th
March, pretend that they still believed that the
Belgians gouge out the eyes of wounded men and
choke them to death with sawdust when <i xml:lang="de">Vorwärts</i>
had succeeded in getting at the truth, and had been
protesting against these lies since the month of
January? Besides, the Germans know their own
"reptile" Press, and they ought to realize that their
newspapers do not merit credence, least of all in time
of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>But even if we absolve these writers of the crime
of lying, to accuse them of nothing worse than inconceivable
credulity, we cannot on any pretext extend
the same indulgence to those who are incontestably
in a position to know the truth. To cite only one
example&mdash;is it not shameful that Baron von Bissing
the younger should publish <i>in April 1915</i>, in the
<i xml:lang="de">Süddeutsche Monatshefte</i>, an article on Belgium in
which he repeats the accusations against the
"<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>," and the tales of Belgians mutilating
the German wounded? And what are
we to say of the reply made by the German
Minister of War to Mlle. Leman according to
which the German troops have never ill-treated
priests (p. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>), nor touched the property of the
Church? A visit to Bueken (near Louvain) gives
the reply to this twofold assertion. In May 1915
one could still see, in the sacristy, the muniment
chest which had contained the sacred vessels; it had
been broken open by the Germans with the aid of a
bell-clapper. As for the curé, M. De Clerck, we know
what he suffered; he was shot after his ears and nose
were cut off. With the curé his assistant was killed:
Father Vincentius Sombroek, a conventual, born at
Zaandam, in Holland.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The picture-postcard has, of course, not been
forgotten. The Germans had on sale in Brussels,
for their soldiers, a coloured card of <i>The Uhlans</i>
<i>before Paris</i>. It shows groups of German cavalrymen
contemplating Paris and the Eiffel Tower.
This card is published by R. and K., and bears the
number 500.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>
<p>This same firm fabricated some remarkable cards
relating to the military operations in Belgium.
No. 507 represents the bombardment of Antwerp.
It shows the city in flames, seen from the Tête de
Flandre, and it also shows guns installed in the
same locality. Now the Germans never had guns
on the left bank of the Scheldt. No. 502 shows the
bombardment of Namur by means of guns firing from
Jambes, which again is incorrect. These cards, it
should be noted, were still being sold in June 1915;
that is, when every one knew that these pictures
were "faked."</p>


<p><i>The Germans' Treatment of Mgr. Mercier.</i></p>

<p>There are other examples of continuity of falsehood
than those relating to violations of the Hague Convention
and the Treaty of London (1839). For
example, a long series of lies was directed against
one single individual&mdash;Mgr. Mercier, Cardinal-Archbishop
of Malines, Primate of Belgium.</p>

<p>The facts are so well known that there is no need
of lengthy comment.</p>

<p>1. Mgr. Mercier went to Rome for the Conclave.
We learned in Belgium, by a placard dated the 8th
September, that the Cardinal was returning to his
country "with a safe-conduct, passing through the
German lines."</p>

<p><i>A lie.</i>&mdash;The Cardinal never had any German
safe-conduct. He returned to Belgium by way of
Lyons, Paris, Havre (where he delivered a speech),
London, and Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>2. During his stay in Rome the Cardinal made
declarations very unfavourable to the Germans. A
placard of the 12th September, 1914, assured us that
he protested against the interview in the <i xml:lang="il">Corriere
della Sera</i>.</p>

<p><i>A lie.</i>&mdash;The <i xml:lang="il">Corriere della Sera</i> is a neutral journal
(in the sense that the Belgian <i xml:lang="fr">Le Soir</i> is neutral),
and the Germans wished to produce the impression
that the Cardinal had been interviewed by a correspondent
of this newspaper. Now he was interviewed
by the editor of the Catholic journal, the <i xml:lang="il">Corriere
d'Italia</i>. This is merely one of the "errors" of
Cardinal von Hartmann's rectification. The whole
is in keeping with this; but it is too long to consider
in detail.</p>

<p>3. Baron von der Goltz, at the moment of leaving
Belgium, of which he had been Governor-General,
thought fit to assert that he had come to an agreement
with Mgr. Mercier as to the reopening of the
courses in the University of Louvain (<i xml:lang="fr">Le Réveil</i>,
1st December, 1914).</p>

<p><i>A lie.</i>&mdash;There was never any question of resuming
these courses.</p>

<p>4. The Cardinal published his famous Pastoral
Letter, which was sent to all the churches of his
diocese, to be read from the pulpit. It recalled the
present sufferings of the country, and adjured
Belgians to "remain faithful to their king and their
laws."</p>

<p>Directly the Germans, informed by their spies,
knew of the existence of this pastoral letter they
withdrew Cardinal Mercier's authorization to visit
the other bishops in his motor-car. At the same
time they forbade the curés to make the letter known
to their parishioners; they even proceeded to seize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the pamphlet in the presbyteries. Naturally the
priests refused to obey the German injunctions, and
the beginning of the <i>mandamus</i> was read from the
pulpit on Sunday, the 3rd January, 1915. The
Germans were furious, and forbade the curés to
continue the reading of the letter; and, the more
readily to obtain their submission, showed them a
German declaration, signed by von Bissing, of which
this is the translation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, <i>7th January, 1915</i>.<br />
</div>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">To the Clergy of the Diocese of Malines.</span></div>

<p>As a result of my remarks, Cardinal Mercier of Malines has
declared to me verbally and in writing that he had no intention of
exciting or alarming the population by his pastoral letter, and he
had not expected any such effect. That he had particularly
insisted on the necessity of obedience on the part of the population
towards the occupier, even if a patriot should inwardly feel
in a state of opposition.</p>

<p>In case I should nevertheless fear an exciting effect, the
Cardinal did not insist on requiring of his clergy the repeated
reading of the pastoral letter on the succeeding Sundays, provided
for in the conclusion of the letter, nor the distribution
of the letter.</p>

<p>My hypothesis has proved correct.</p>

<p>I therefore repeat my prohibition of the 2nd January of this
year, concerning the reading and the diffusion of the pastoral
letter. I draw the attention of the clergy to this point&mdash;that
they will be acting in contradiction to the written declaration
of their Cardinal in disobeying his prohibition.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Baron von Bissing</span>,<br />
<i>Colonel-General</i>.<br />
<i>Governor-General in Belgium.</i><br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p><i>A lie.</i>&mdash;This declaration is false. Mgr. Evrard,
Dean of St. Gudule in Brussels, went to see
Mgr. Mercier at Malines, and obtained proof of the
falsehood. He at once warned all the curés of Brussels
and the district of the man&oelig;uvre, and on Sunday,
the 10th January, the reading of the letter was
resumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

written prohibition is cunning and spurious.</p>

<p>"Neither verbally, nor in writing, have I withdrawn anything,
nor do I now withdraw anything of my previous instructions, and
I protest against the violence done against the liberty of my
pastoral ministry."</p>

<p>That is what the Cardinal dictated to me.</p>

<p>He added: "They have done everything to make me sign
mitigations of my letter; I have not signed them. Now they
seek to separate my clergy from me, by forbidding them to
read it.</p>

<p>"I have done my duty; my clergy know if they will do
theirs."</p>

<p>5. Baron von Bissing published in the newspapers

<p>The facts will show that this assertion is contrary to the truth.
As a matter of fact, on the evening of the 1st January, and
during the whole of the night, soldiers entered the presbyteries
and took from the priests, or vainly endeavoured to take, the
pastoral letter, and, in contempt of episcopal authority, forbade
you to read it to the assembled faithful, under the threat of
extremely severe punishment which would be inflicted on
yourselves or on your parish.</p>

<p>Even our dignity was not respected. For on the 2nd of
January, before sunrise even, that is, at six o'clock, I was ordered
to present myself on the morning of that same day before the
Governor-General, to justify my letter to the clergy and the
people; on the following day I was forbidden to preside at
Benediction in the Cathedral of Antwerp; lastly, I was forbidden
to visit the other Belgian bishops.</p>

<p>As a citizen, a pastor of souls, and a member of the Sacred
College of Cardinals I protest that your rights, well-beloved
brothers, and my own, have been infringed.</p>

<p>Whatever has been pretended, experience has proved that
no danger of sedition has resulted from this pastoral letter, but
rather that it contributed greatly to the peace and tranquillity
of the public.</p>

<p>I congratulate you with having accomplished your duty firmly
and harmoniously. Remain devoted to it with a manly and
peaceable heart, recalling those words in which I have already
fully and entirely expressed my thought: "Be at once the best
guardians of patriotism and the supporters of public order."</p>

let us recommend the bishop, the clergy, and the faithful
"that they may behold their duty and be strong to fulfil it."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>6. On Sunday, the 3rd January, 1915, the Cardinal
did not go to Antwerp, as he had intended. The
Germans announced in the newspapers&mdash;in <i xml:lang="fr">L'Avenir</i>
(Antwerp), for example&mdash;that the Cardinal's absence
was voluntary.</p>

<p><i>A lie.</i>&mdash;They had forbidden Mgr. Mercier to leave
Malines.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have mentioned that while these things were
happening the clergy continued to make the pastoral
letter known in all the churches, except in those
cases where the Germans had succeeded in subtracting
the copies of the letter. But even there
the reading of the letter was resumed after a brief
interval, when fresh impressions of the letter had
been printed and distributed all over the country.
This propaganda was, of course, secret; an official
<i xml:lang="fr">communiqué</i> published at Namur, on the 12th
January, 1915, leaves no doubt as to that. It
threatens the infliction of severe punishment on
those who should distribute this document. To
give some idea of the activity with which the pastoral
letter was distributed throughout Belgium,
we may mention that we know of twelve different
editions in French and two in Flemish; there are,
moreover, at least two typewritten editions. Each
impression numbered thousands of copies; of one
single edition the Germans seized 35,000 copies!
We may add that a German translation also has
appeared, but this is <i xml:lang="la">ad usum Germanorum</i>. The
interesting passages are suppressed.</p>

<p>The pastoral letter was not without results in
Rome. The Belgian colony there organized a mass
for the priests put to death in Belgium, a list of
whom was given by the Cardinal. The organ of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>

death" by <i xml:lang="il">caduti</i>, "fallen." This vague term might
allow it to be supposed that the priests had fallen on
the field of battle, not that they were assassinated
by the German troops. The German newspapers
were jubilant. The <i xml:lang="de">Kölnische Volkszeitung</i>, one of
the leading Catholic organs in Germany, edited by
Herr Julius Bachem, published an article to show
that the Holy See had not been duped by the tricks
of the Belgians, and refused to credit the tale of
priests put to death by the Germans (see <i xml:lang="nl">Het Vaderland</i>,
31st March, 1915, 2nd sheet, evening). The
<i xml:lang="de">Düsseldorfer Anzeiger</i> also contained a long and far-fetched
article in its issue of the 29th January.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Organization of Propaganda.</span></p>

<p>With the methodical spirit which they boast of
possessing, the Germans have from the outset of
the war created bureaux for the propagation of the
"German idea" throughout the world. Some of
these organizations of propaganda have for their
province the neutral countries, among which, in the
first rank, are the United States, the Scandinavian
countries, Italy, Holland, and Switzerland. Others
deal with the occupied countries, or enemy countries,
through the intermediary of prisoners of war and
civil prisoners. Finally, there are those that deal
with Germany and her allies. If we add to the
bureaux of propaganda situated in Germany, and
operating thence, those established and operating in
foreign countries, we shall begin to understand the
power of expansion and penetration possessed by
such instruments in the hands of unscrupulous
people.</p>

<p>Again, we must reckon not only with the official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
or semi-official propaganda, devoid of the mercenary
spirit, whose only object is the triumph of Germany.
There are a number of publishing concerns which
pursue the same objects.</p>

<p>Besides her printed propaganda, Germany makes
use of other means, apparently accessory and occasional,
but whose effects may become very appreciable;
visits of German scholars and German
politicians, especially socialist politicians; letters
written by Germans to friends or relations abroad;
inquiries addressed to the scholars of neutral
countries; promises made to notable persons, in
the hope of obtaining their co-operation.</p>

<p>One word before examining the working of these
organizations. Should we really classify them under
the heading of "falsehoods"? After what we have
said of the methods of the German Press, and the
mentality of the German rulers, no one will hesitate,
we fancy, as to the place which falsehood must be
accorded in this propaganda. But so that no doubt
shall remain in the reader's mind, we will give a few
quotations from the propagandist literature relating
to Belgium.</p>


<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Propagandist Bureaux operating in
Germany.</i></p>

<p>The most important of the propagandist pamphlets
appearing in Germany is a monthly publication. It
is known, in French, as the <i xml:lang="fr">Journal de la Guerre</i>.
We know it also in German and in Dutch; probably
it is translated into yet other languages. Each
number consists of 40 to 72 pages, and contains
general information, a chronicle of the war, photographs
and drawings, tales of the battles, etc. ...
in short, everything that can influence the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
opinion of neutral countries. In almost every number
is an article tending to prove that Germany was
forced, for reasons of self-defence, to invade Belgium;
that Belgium, moreover, had violated her own
neutrality in advance; that the Belgians amply
deserve their fate, on account of their wicked
treatment of wounded men (gouging out their eyes,
etc.). We have already mentioned the <i xml:lang="fr">Journal
de la Guerre</i> with reference to a "faked" map of
Louvain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr">Journal de la Guerre</i> published an article by
Herr Helfferich on a journey through Belgium,
undertaken in September 1914. It is teeming with
inaccuracies, but it would be waste of time to refute
them all. We will confine ourselves to the first
sentence, which states that the burgomaster of
Battice has been shot. Now, this is untrue: the
burgomaster of Battice, M. Rosette, who has filled
his office for many years, is in excellent health, and
is still living in Battice.</p>

<p>Another publication&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr">La Guerre&mdash;Journal périodique
paraissant durant la guerre de 1914-15</i>&mdash;is
intended for prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The best method of impressing the prisoners is
assuredly to show them that in their own country
people are already beginning to realize the indisputable
superiority of Germany. So <i xml:lang="fr">La Guerre</i>
frequently publishes articles reprinted from <i xml:lang="fr">La
Gazette des Ardennes</i>; only it forgets to mention
that <i xml:lang="fr">La Gazette des Ardennes</i> is a newspaper
established, edited, and printed exclusively by
Germans, since the occupation. Shall we take
another example of duplicity? For the Belgians,
naturally, what their priests tell them has great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
weight with them. No. 14 of <i xml:lang="fr">La Guerre</i> reproduces
a passage from an article (which is mentioned on
p. 129) originally published by "the priest Domela
Nieuwenhuis, of Gand." Here is a falsehood:
M. Domela Nieuwenhuis is not a priest; he is a
Protestant pastor in Gand. In the quotation M.
Nieuwenhuis says: "If we Flemings had been
properly informed...." (<i xml:lang="fr">La Guerre</i>, No. 14,
p. 217).</p>

<p>"We Flemings," M. Nieuwenhuis is supposed to
have said ... and he is a Dutchman. This is
curious. Let us compare this with the original
text in <i>De Tijdspiegel</i>, p. 316, 1st April, 1915.
There we find: "<i xml:lang="nl">Indien wij hier in Vlaanderen
... zouden zign voorgelicht....</i>" ("If we, here in
Flanders, had been informed....") The German
forgers have been at work, and by a little tinkering at
the text, they have made a Dutch pastor pass for a
Flemish priest! To what are they not reduced!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The pamphlet <i xml:lang="de">Die Wahrheit über den Krieg</i> speaks
on p. 93 of an international propagandist organisation
established in Berlin: the <i>Commission for the
publication of impartial news abroad</i> (we translate
from the Dutch version). This Commission publishes
<i>Correspondence for Neutrals</i>, which aims solely at
"distributing positive news concerning the working
of social, juridicial, economic, and moral institutions
and general culture in Germany." Its articles
are especially intended for use by the Press. It
appears two or three times a week, in ten different
languages, and will continue to do so during the war.
It asserts that its expenses are covered entirely by
private subscriptions.</p>

<p>At the Superior Technical College of Stuttgart is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
established the <i xml:lang="de">Süddeutsche Nachrichtenstelle für die
Neutralen</i> (South German News Bureau for the
Neutrals). It publishes propagandist leaflets at
irregular intervals and of various dimensions, which
are intended to furnish "the verifiable truth as to
the origin, course, and results of the war."</p>

<p>The professors of the University of Leipzig sent
abroad a special number of the <i xml:lang="de">Leipziger Neueste
Nachrichte</i> of the 25th August, 1914, which gave,
in chronological order, "the truth about the causes
of the war and the German successes." The truth!
Its capital falsehoods are too numerous for examination
here.</p>

<p>At Düsseldorf is the <i xml:lang="de">Büro zur Verbreitung deutscher
Nachrichten im Auslande</i> (the German
Bureau for distributing German news abroad).
The French version of this title is <i xml:lang="fr">Bureau allemand
pour la publication de nouvelles authentiques
à l'Etranger</i>. Observe, in passing, that <i xml:lang="de">Deutsche
Nachrichten</i> is translated as "authentic news,"
which will not fail to surprise the reader. This
Bureau used to publish <i xml:lang="fr">Le Réveil</i>, a remarkable
journal sold in Belgium and the occupied parts of
France.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="de">Deutscher Überseedienst</i> (German Overseas
Service) busies itself particularly with the falsification
of public opinion abroad. Its publications are
usually distributed gratis.</p>

<p>For Americans living in Europe, Germany provides
<i>The Continental Times, Special War Edition
and Journal for Americans in Europe</i>, edited at the
Hôtel Adon in Berlin. To judge of the veracity of
this journal, it is enough to read, in the issue for the
8th February, the article by Herr J. E. Noegerath,
devoted to his journey through Belgium. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
we learn that "Malines was bombarded simultaneously
by the Belgians and the Germans; the
cathedral, somewhat seriously damaged, is about
to be repaired by the Germans." St. Rombaut
repaired by the Germans! This exceeds even the
German limits! Well, the Americans in Europe
have a chance of obtaining positive information.</p>

<p><i>The League of German Scientists and Artists for
the Defence of Civilization</i> (in French they make it
<i xml:lang="fr">La Ligue pour la défense de la civilisation</i>&mdash;for the
<i>prevention</i>&mdash;which is just what it is!) is installed
in the Palace of the Academy of Science in Berlin,
Unter den Linden, 38. It publishes pamphlets;
for example, that of Herr Riesser, on <i>The Success of
the German War Loan</i>. As far as we know it has
published nothing about Belgium.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A very interesting method of propaganda is that
which consists in attaching to business letters leaflets
printed on very thin paper, giving "authentic"
news in the language of the recipient. <i>The Hamburger
Fremdenblatt</i> has published many of these,
at 10 pfennigs for 10 copies. They include, notably,
<i>Appeals to Christians</i>; <i>An Appeal to the Catholic
Missions</i>, in German, English, Spanish, Portuguese,
French, and Italian; <i>An Appeal to the Protestant
Missions</i>, in German, English, and Portuguese.</p>

<p>Another series of leaflets to be inserted in letters
is published by the <i xml:lang="de">Bureau des Deutschen Handelstages,
Berlin</i> (Bureau of the German Commercial
Conference of Berlin). Nine different leaflets
appeared. No. 10 and the succeeding leaflets are
of different origin; these leaflets are now published
by the <i xml:lang="de">Kriegs-Auschuss der Deutschen Industrie,
Berlin</i> (Military Commission of German Industry).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
No. 10 reproduces a proclamation by Dr. Schroedter,
threatening to strip the Belgians of all their copper,
"down to the last door-handle."</p>

<p>In Germany also are published leaflets bearing no
indication of their origin. One of these, entitled
<i>What is the Cause of the Severity of the War?</i> is
curious for more reasons than one.</p>


<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Propagandist Matter issued by the Publishing
Houses.</i></p>

<p>There are, to begin with, the numerous low-priced
pamphlets which carry the gospel to the soldiers in
the trenches, and enlighten the home population.
The most voluminous and the most perfidious of
these books is that of Major Viktor von Strantz:
<i xml:lang="de">Die Eroberung Belgiëns</i>.</p>

<p>Several publishing houses issue series of booklets,
under some general title. We may mention:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i xml:lang="de">Krieg und Sieg, 1914, nach Berichten der Zeitgenossen</i> (War
and Victory, 1914, according to the Accounts of Eye-witnesses).</p>

<p><i xml:lang="de">Der Deutschen Volkes Kriegstagebuch</i> (The German People's
Diary of the War).</p>

<p><i xml:lang="de">Der Weltkrieg, 1914</i> (The World-war of 1914), at 20 pfennigs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Besides these works, which are intended rather
for the masses, we must mention others, intended
for a more intellectual public.</p>

<p>Such are:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i xml:lang="de">Reden aus der Kriegzeit</i>; <i xml:lang="de">Deutsche Vortrage Hamburgischer
Professoren</i>; <i xml:lang="de">Zwischen Krieg und Frieden</i>; <i xml:lang="de">Der Deutsche Krieg</i>;
<i xml:lang="de">Kriegsberichte aus den Grossen Hauptquartier.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>To these we may add works appearing in small
isolated volumes at a low price, containing more
especially diplomatic documents:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i xml:lang="de">Deutschland in der Notwehr</i> (Carl Schüsemann, Bremen); <i xml:lang="de">Das
Volkerringen, 1914</i>, F. M. Kireheisen (Universal Bibliothek,
Leipzig).</p>

<p><i xml:lang="de">Urkunden, Depeschen und Berichte der Frankfurter Zeitung.
Der Grosse Krieg. Eine Chronich von Tag zu Tag</i> (Frankfurt,
1914-15).</p></blockquote>

<p>We must not overlook the numerous illustrated
publications, among which we may mention the
<i xml:lang="fr">Album de la Grande Guerre</i>, published by the
<i xml:lang="de">Deutscher Überseedienst</i>, with explanations in
German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, and
Portuguese. This collection contains a number of
illustrations relating to Belgium: for example, in
No. 2 we have "A Zeppelin bombarding Liége,"
which never happened (p. 229): and No. 3 gives us
a view of the Place des Bailles at Malines, "a
quarter where the houses were destroyed by Belgian
artillery" (whereas the Belgian artillery destroyed
nothing in Malines, and the Place des Bailles was
not bombarded but burned).</p>


<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Propangandist Bureaux operating Abroad.</i></p>

<p>Not content with flooding neutrals with literature
fabricated in Germany itself, to such an extent that
the former complained of the German importunity,
the Germans have also set up bureaux of propaganda
in foreign countries. The most important of these,
without doubt, is that which has been operating in
the United States, under the direction of Herr
Bernhard Dernburg, ex-Minister of the Empire.
Herr Dernburg has neglected no means of action,
and has not feared to mount into the breach himself
in his efforts to ensure the triumph of his cause.</p>

<p>In Belgium the propaganda was of a multiple
nature. In the first place, the Germans were careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to inform us, daily, by means of placards, as to the
"actual" results of the military operations, and
they distributed tens of thousands of copies of circulars
relating to the "Anglo-Belgian Conventions"
(p. <a href="#Page_43">43</a>), the Griendl report (p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>), the retirement
of Italy from the Triple Alliance, etc. As these
might not have enlightened us sufficiently, the
German authorities took the Press in hand, the
result being such journals as <i xml:lang="fr">Le Réveil</i> and
the <i xml:lang="de">Deutsche Soldatenpost</i>. They then censored
the Belgian papers in various manners.</p>

<p>(1) The Germans wished to compel various papers
to appear under their control. All those in the
capital refused; but in the provinces certain newspapers,
such as <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> (at Namur) and
<i xml:lang="fr">Le Bien Public</i> (at Gand), accepted the German
conditions. <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> was really and
truly forced to appear; as it admitted, in a covert
fashion, in its issues of the 20th and 27th August,
and explicitly in those of the 7th October and the
6th November.</p>

<p>(2) The German authorities forced these journals,
and others which have since been established, to
publish propagandist articles, imposing penalties in
case of failure. Thus <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> (it was
suggested that it might be called <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de par
Ordre!</i>) was obliged to publish stories of "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"
which it knew were inventions; and after
the burning of the Grand' Place at Namur (concerning
which it knew very well what to think) it
published, in large letters, on the 28th August,
1914, a protest against <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>. On the
1st September followed an article describing the
punishment of Louvain after an attack by civilians.
On the following day was further mention of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
"leaders" who brought such terrible reprisals on
their fellow-citizens. In order to make these
flagrant lies "go down," the journal is compelled
from time to time to repeat that it prints nothing
but the truth (for example, on the 7th September).</p>

<p>Incontestably imposed, also, are the articles which
basely flatter the Germans; notably its excuses after
its suspension (7th and 8th December) and its thanks
to the Military Government of Namur when the
latter ceased to take hostages (on the 29th September).
In this last issue is an equally characteristic
article on the subject of the Cathedral of
Reims; in this the German Government pretends
that it did not allege the presence of an observation-post
on the Cathedral. But one has only to read
the official communiqués of the 23rd September in
order to prove that <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> has been
forced to lie to its readers.</p>

<p>Of course the Germans deny that they demand
the insertion of these articles (see <i xml:lang="fr">Le Bien Public</i>,
1st November, 1914); otherwise their readers would
cease to give any credence to these "Belgian"
papers.</p>

<p>(3) The principal mission of the censorship consists
in suppressing all that displeases it and all
that it regards as compromising. Thus, for two
months <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> did not publish a single
communiqué from the armies of the Allies, although
it pretended the contrary in its issue of the 7th
October. It was only on the 26th that it began to
publish them; but it then borrowed them from the
German papers, which was not perhaps a guarantee
of exactitude. At the same time <i xml:lang="fr">Le Bruxellois</i>
stated that there were scarcely any French communiqués.
As for <i xml:lang="fr">Le Bien Public</i>, it was suspended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
during the whole of May 1915, because
the censorship would no longer allow it to publish
the communiqués of the Allies.</p>

<p>The censorship had promised the journals whose
publication it permitted (or demanded) that it would
not mutilate articles, but would suppress them entirely
(<i xml:lang="fr">Le Bien Public</i>, 1st November, 1914). Of
course, it did not keep its engagements; for what
engagement did our enemies ever keep? To realize
how the censorship mutilates, curtails, and falsifies
one has only to compare the official telegrams contained
in the French newspapers with those which
are vouchsafed us by the expurgated journals. Here
are a few examples; it will be seen that the censorship
suppresses not only sentences and parts of sentences,
but single words, and even parts of words.
We will confess that this last procedure was totally
unexpected, even on the part of Germany, although
her scholars have certainly acquired a habit of
splitting hairs.</p>

censorship:&mdash;</p>

<p>To appreciate at its full value the mutilation of
the official communiqués by the German censorship,
it must be recalled (1) that it had undertaken to
leave the official communiqués untouched, and
(2) that the subservient portion of the press continued
to call them "official telegrams."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Sincerity of the Censored Newspapers.</i></p>

<p>At the outset the censorship used to allow newspapers
to leave a blank space in the place of an
article, phrase, or words deleted. But this procedure
was too frank for the Germans, and the
readers were aware of it; so the German authorities
forced the newspapers to fill up the blanks; and
in order to facilitate their task they published a
special typewritten journal, appearing in French
and in Flemish, <i xml:lang="fr">Le Courrier Belge</i>, in which "all
the articles had passed the censorship." Editors,
therefore, had only to select an article of the desired
length in order to fill the gaps left by the official
scissors.</p>

<p>We may add that by the terms of a decision
given in the Court of First Instance in Brussels,
the journals at present appearing in Germany under
the German censorship may not claim the title of
Belgian newspapers.</p>

<p>It may readily be imagined what the censored
journals have become under this delightful system.
But a story which is told in Belgium will perhaps
give the reader a better idea of their vicissitudes.
The soul of a soldier presents itself at the gate
of Paradise. "Who are you?" says St. Peter.
After a long hesitating pause (for no one cares to
make such a painful confession) the soul replies:
"I am the soul of a German soldier." "You are
an impudent liar!" cries St. Peter. "I read the
Belgian newspapers with the greatest care, and
they have not yet announced the death of a
single German soldier!"</p>

<p>On the 7th June, 1915, the Germans had a unique
opportunity of proving that the German journals in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Belgian clothes, such as <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique</i>,
<i xml:lang="fr">Le Bien Public</i>, etc., were still capable on
occasion of speaking the truth. But they allowed
the opportunity to slip. However, here are the
facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the night of Sunday, the 6th June, 1915,
towards 2.30 a.m., we were awakened by a furious
cannonade and the explosion of bombs: Allied
aviators were bombarding the shed of the dirigible
at Evere, to which they set fire, destroying both
shed and balloon. On the same day we learned
that a second German dirigible had just been
destroyed at Mont St.-Amand, near Gand, by a
British aviator. We awaited the next day's papers
with curiosity. Would they report the two incidents,
making as little of them as possible, or
would they keep silence? They merely stated that
the German air-fleet had raided the English coast
on the night of the 7th. Of what happened on its
return, not a word. In the <i xml:lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</i>, again,
there was nothing said as to the disasters at Evere
and Mont St.-Amand. So the muzzled Press of
Belgium and Germany may speak of German successes
(we are supposing, of course, that the bombardment
of open towns <i>is</i> a success), but as to
the failures they are dumb. These are two facts
which are known to hundreds of thousands of
persons, and are therefore impossible of concealment.
To keep silence, therefore, could have only
one result, namely, to prove that the German communiqués
are "faked," and that the Belgian journals
are muzzled: in short, that all news which comes
from Germany is adulterated. If our oppressors had
published a short paragraph dealing with these two
"accidents," then a few Belgians, more credulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
than their fellows, might have continued to believe
that the word "German" can still on occasion be
spoken in the same breath as the word "sincerity."
But in their incomparable stupidity the censors (who
are doubtless diplomatists out of a job) failed to
realize that by preserving silence as to the raids
of the British aviators they were for ever destroying
the value of their newspapers. They rendered us a
similar service, on this occasion, to that which they
rendered when they forbade M. Max to publish the
statement that they were liars (p. <a href="#Page_233">233</a>). We were
well aware that the German was a shocking psychologist,
but we hardly realized how shocking!...
The incident is, as will be seen, the pendant of the
story of the Liége Zeppelin. This dirigible raided
Liége on the night of the 6th August, and the raid
was described in the German newspapers and even
illustrated. Unfortunately the raid never took
place!</p>

<p>A few days later the Germans plunged even deeper
into the mire. On the night of the 16th June
the people of Brussels once again heard the sound
of guns, this time from Berchem; but no one saw
an aeroplane. Next day the papers contained a
paragraph stating that an attack by enemy aviators
had been repulsed. Did the raid really take place?
It is doubtful; and in any case it does not matter.
The essential point is that on this occasion the
newspapers were allowed to speak.</p>

<p>The Governor-General, who has a keen sense of
the fitting opportunity, chose this moment to inform
us that a mischievous Press was circulating in
Belgium (see <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique</i>, 14th January, 1915).
Nothing could be truer, as the reader has just
seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Persecution of Uncensored Newspapers.</i></p>

<p>Naturally, the desire to obtain foreign newspapers
became keener than ever in Belgium as the untruthfulness
of the censored journals became more
apparent. To the notices published by the Germans
forbidding the distribution of "false news" (p. <a href="#Page_187">187</a>)
we may add an official communiqué which was
reproduced in <i xml:lang="fr">L'ami de l'Ordre</i> on the 17th
October:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Any person who shall spread similar false reports, or cause
them to be distributed, will be shot without mercy."</p></blockquote>


<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Various Propaganda.</i></p>

<p>Lastly, let us mention&mdash;without insistence, as
they are already sufficiently familiar&mdash;various
methods of propaganda which are individual, and
apparently spontaneous, but from which the
Germans expect very happy results.</p>

<p>All those Belgians who have friends or relations
in Germany, and all those who are themselves of
German origin, have incessantly been receiving,
since correspondence between the two countries has
been permitted, letters in which they are told that
Germany is sure of victory, that the Belgians have
been deceived by England and by their king, that
the Germans do no harm to any one, etc. These
assertions are repeated with such regularity and
monotony that they produce the impression of a
lesson that has been learned; so, to avoid this
unfortunate impression, the correspondents are
careful to declare that they are only expressing their
personal opinion.</p>

<p>Next, we may mention the foreign visits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
German scholars; for example, that of Herr
Ostwald (one of the Ninety-three) to Sweden, and
that of Herr Lamprecht (another of the Ninety-three)
to Belgium. Herr Ostwald's lectures have
evoked a great sensation, but it was perhaps hardly
the sensation Germany had hoped for; moreover,
the University of Leipzig declared that it did not
subscribe to the ideas of its sometime professor.
The effort of Herr Lamprecht was more discreet; it
was preceded by a written effort, but letter and
visit had the same negative result.</p>

<p>More insidious are the visits made to Belgium by
prominent German socialists: Wendel, Liebknecht,
Noske, Koester, etc. They, too, hoped easily to
convince us of the rights and, above all, of the
superiority of Germany. They went back with an
empty bag; one may even venture to assert that
they were rather shaken, since Herr Liebknecht
complains, in a conversation with an editor of the
<i>Social-Demokraten</i>, a Norwegian organ, of the part
which the Socialist missionaries were made to play
(<i>N.R.C.</i>, 28th December, 1914, evening).</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="de">Vossische Zeitung</i> has discovered another
means of propaganda. This journal sent a paper
of questions to Dutch and Scandinavian scholars,
asking them what their science owes to Germany.
A shallow trick, this; every nation has naturally
produced men of mark, to whom science has cause
for gratitude.</p>


<p>4. <span class="smcap">The Violation of Engagements.</span></p>

<p>The war began by the violation of a solemn treaty,
to which Germany subscribed in 1839. The entire
conduct of the war has been, as far as Germany
is concerned, a long series of violations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Hague Convention of 1907. Germany alleges, in
her own defence, that circumstances have altered
since the period when these pacts were signed; that
she was obliged to forestall France; that in case of
absolute necessity, such as that in which she stood,
she has the right to use all means of injuring the
enemy, permitted or not (p. <a href="#Page_83">83</a>); and moreover, that
the torpedoing of the <i>Lusitania</i> (p. <a href="#Page_194">194</a>), the employment
of living shields (p. <a href="#Page_117">117</a>), the use of toxic
gases (p. <a href="#Page_198">198</a>), and terrorization by fire and assassination
(p. <a href="#Page_164">164</a>), having proved efficacious, it is
in her interests not to neglect them out of mere
humanity, or a simple and childish respect for her
own signature.</p>

<p>It is hopeless to discuss the matter; it would be
wasted pains, Germany having decided to let her
conduct be shaped by the impulse of the moment,
without hampering herself with any anterior
promises. She is fighting for her life, her publicists
and statesmen never cease repeating, and she is free
to throw all her engagements to the wind. "<i xml:lang="de">Not
kennt kein Gebot</i>," declared the Chancellor, on the
9th August, and this convenient maxim has lost
nothing of its popularity.</p>

<p>But there are other engagements, engagements
which Germany has entered into with Belgium since
the beginning of the war, and which she has broken
with the same ease: a promise to restore Belgium's
independence; a promise to respect our patriotism,
a promise to pay cash for all requisitions once the
tribute of 480 millions frs. was paid, etc. Our
enemies can invoke no extenuating circumstances to
mitigate these breaches of faith, for no change had
occurred between the dates of making these engagements
and their violation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>


<p><i>The Independence of Belgium.</i></p>

<p>On the 4th August, 1914, the very day on
which our country was invaded, the Imperial
Government made one last effort to extort from
England a promise of neutrality. It gave an assurance
that even in the case of an armed conflict with
Belgium, Germany would not on any pretext annex
her territory (<i xml:lang="fr">Livre Bleu</i>, No. 74). On that very
day the Kaiser and the Chancellor made similar
declarations: "We shall repair the injustice which
we are committing towards Belgium," said the
Chancellor. Directly they had a newspaper at their
disposal in Belgium our invaders published an
article assuring the Belgians of their respect for
whatever engagements they had entered into (see
<i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, 29th and 30th August, 1914).</p>

<p>Words, idle words!</p>

<p>Hardly were the Germans, in boasting mood, able
to style themselves conquerors, than they hastened
to trample their promises underfoot. Are the
engagements of the Berlin Government anything
more than so many scraps of paper, which may with
impunity be declared null and void? Such men as
Erzberger, Losch, Dernburg, Maximilian Harden,
etc., all partaking in the public life of their country,
found nothing was more urgent than to disregard
whatever the Emperor and the Chancellor might
have said, no matter how solemn the circumstances,
and to make plans for the future in which Belgium
would remain wholly or in part annexed.</p>


<p><i>The Promise to respect the Patriotism of the
Belgians.</i></p>

<p>"I ask no one to renounce his patriotic sentiments,"
said Baron von der Goltz in the first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the somewhat extraordinary declarations with
which he gratified us during his stay in our midst
in his quality of Governor-General (placard of
2nd September, 1914).</p>


<p><i>The Forced Striking of the Flag.</i></p>

<p>Every one was anxiously asking himself what was
really the thought at the back of the Baron's head;
for we already knew the Germans sufficiently to
realize that so honeyed a phrase concealed some
peril. But what? Two weeks later the riddle was
solved; it meant that the Belgian national flag
was "regarded as a provocation by the German
troops" (placard of 16th September, 1914). A
provocation of what or whom? Of their national
sentiment? Well, and what of ours, which the
Governor-General was not asking us to renounce?
It is true that after the appearance of this placard
the Military Governor announced that he had "by
no means the intention of wounding the dignity or
the feelings of the inhabitants by this measure; its
sole purpose is to preserve the citizens from any
annoyance." In short, it was for our good that
we were forced to haul down our flag. What was
to be done? To resist would be to give the scoundrels
who were oppressing us an occasion for exercising
their murderous and incendiary talents on Brussels.
By a very dignified and very moderate notice,
M. Max, the burgomaster, counselled his fellow-citizens
to yield. This placard, which was not
subjected to the censorship, despite the order given
by the Germans, displeased them to the point of
having it immediately covered with blank sheets
of paper. But these were torn away by the people of
Brussels, or else they were rendered transparent by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
means of petroleum: in a word, every one could read
the burgomaster's protest. But as it was expected,
with a good show of reason, that the Germans would
soon cause it to disappear completely, many persons
copied the placard, or even photographed it; and
for a long time numbers of the inhabitants of
Brussels carried upon their persons, like a precious
relic, a copy or a photograph of M. Max's famous
placard.</p>


<p><i>The Belgian Colours forbidden in the Provinces.</i></p>

<p>While the withdrawal of the Belgian flag was
demanded, in the provinces a hunt was conducted
for the Belgian colours used in the decoration of
shop-windows. The German police would enter the
shops and demand the immediate removal of all
tricolour ribbons decorating the windows.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Military Court.</span></div>

<p>Henry Dargette, of Namur, Place Arthur Borlée, 32, was
punished with a fine of 10 marks, or 2 days' subsidiary detention,
in accordance with § 13 of the Imperial decree of the 28th
December, 1893, for having disregarded the communiqué of the
Imperial Government of Namur of the 22nd April, 1915. He
had exposed in his shop-window boxes of tin-plate with the
French, British, Russian, and Belgian colours.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, 3-6 July, 1915.)<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>In Brussels it was a long time before they decided
to take measures against the wearing of the tricolour
rosettes which so many people carried in their
buttonholes; in the streets, at least two persons in
three displayed our colours. This persistence on
the part of the Belgians in publicly displaying their
patriotic sentiments is extremely annoying to the
Germans. For proof we need only turn to the letter
from Brussels published in the weekly illustrated
supplement of the <i xml:lang="de">Hamburger Fremdenblatt</i> for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
18th April, 1915: "One does not see a schoolboy,
not a schoolgirl, not a lady, not a gentleman, who
does not wear, in an obvious fashion, the Belgian
cockade." In certain towns&mdash;for example Lessines,
Gand, and Dinant&mdash;this kind of manifestation is
prohibited. At Namur the fine may amount to
500 frs.; the placard which threatens this penalty
is conceived in the involved and nauseating style
which we encounter every time the Germans
inflict on us a particularly disgusting piece of
hypocrisy. In particular it is stated that it is forbidden
"<i>publicly</i> to display the Belgian colours."
No doubt it is permissible to have them floating
about in one's pocket, or to decorate the interior
of one's chest of drawers with them. This is how
the Teuton Tartuffe "asks no one to renounce his
patriotic sentiments":&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Government Communiqués.</span></div>

<p>One may observe, of late, in a great proportion of the inhabitants
of the town, as well as in the young school-children, a tendency
to manifest their patriotic feelings by wearing, in an open manner,
the Belgian colours, under different forms.</p>

<p>I am far from wishing to offend their feelings; on the contrary,
I esteem and respect them.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, I cannot but perceive, in this form [of
display], that it is desired thereby <span class="smcap">Publicly</span> to express a demonstration
against the present state of affairs and against the
German authority, which I expressly forbid.</p>

<p>I consequently direct:</p>

<p>It is strictly forbidden to place in view, publicly, the Belgian
colours, either on oneself, or on any objects whatever, in no
matter what circumstances.</p>

<p>Contraventions will be punished by a fine which may amount
to 500 frs., unless, according to the gravity of the case, the
contravention is punished by imprisonment.</p>

<p>This regulation does not at any time prevent the wearing of
official decorations by those who have the right to do so.</p>

</div></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Prohibition of the Belgian Colours in Brussels.</i></p>

<p>Suddenly, without any pretext, the sight of the
little tricolour decorations worn by the people of
Brussels began to offend the Germans, and the
national emblem was prohibited from the 1st July,
1915. The prohibition was posted only on the
30th of June. It made a distinction between the
Belgian colours, the wearing of which was tolerated
if it was not provocative, and the colours of our
Allies, the display of which, even if not provocative,
was absolutely prohibited. How were our German
bumpkins going to make this much too subtle distinction
between provocative and non-provocative
display? This evidently left the door open to all
sorts of arbitrary actions. So the people of Brussels
judged it prudent to renounce their badges entirely.
A few, however, replaced the rosette by an ivy-leaf, the
emblem of fidelity in the language of flowers. What
were the Germans to do now? Prohibit the wearing
of the ivy-leaf, perhaps, for by the 5th July they
had forbidden the manufacture and sale of artificial
ivy-leaves, whether of cloth or paper. But they did
not persist in this course. For the first time since
we had been subject to them they conceived a witty
idea. They themselves began to display the ivy-leaf;
from that moment this emblem could not decently
be worn by any of us. It would be interesting to
know who inspired them with this ingenious idea.</p>


<p><i>The "Te Deum" on the Patron Saint's Day
of the King.</i></p>

<p>Let us note the date of <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> which
contained Baron von Hirschberg's announcement:
the 15th November, the patron saint's day of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
King. The same copy of the paper reproduced an
article from <i xml:lang="de">Düsseldorfer General Anzeiger</i>, which
doubtless had escaped the censor, doing homage to
the valour of the King and Queen. On the following
day <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> had to announce that the
usual <i xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> would not be performed. Why was
the ceremony suppressed? The paper did not say;
but we can easily guess; the superior German
authorities had decided otherwise.</p>

<p>In Brussels also the <i xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> of the 15th November
was prohibited. It was decided to replace it by a
mass which would be sung at 11 o'clock in the
church of St. Gudule. By 10.30 the church was
overflowing with people; but towards 11.0 a priest
passed quietly through the ranks of the faithful,
announcing that the singing of the Mass had been
prohibited by the Germans, and that it would be
replaced by a Low Mass. After this some hundreds
of persons repaired to the Palais Royal, to the gate
in the Rue Bréderode; they expected that a book
would be there, as usual, to receive their signatures.
The register had been there, but the German
authorities had removed it. The callers then
decided merely to leave their cards; but a Palace
servant came to inform them that the Germans,
after removing the register, had also forbidden the
formation of assemblies near the Palace, and had
even made some arrests; he therefore begged the
public to disperse. More respect for patriotic
sentiments!</p>


<p><i>The Portraits of the Royal Family.</i></p>

<p>Since then it has been forbidden to sell portraits of
the Royal Family published since the outbreak of the
war. In particular those picture-postcards are prohibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
which represent the King as a soldier, the
King with his Staff, the King in the trenches, the
King on the dunes, the King with General Joffre,
the King at Furnes, the Queen as a nurse, Prince
Leopold as a trooper, etc. The prohibition is
applied with an incoherence which accords ill with
the wonderful spirit of organization with which our
persecutors are credited. In certain parts of Brussels
the vendors have never been disturbed; in others,
they may sell the cards in the shops, but may not
expose them in the windows; elsewhere it is a crime
even to have the cards in stock. In short, all is left
to the caprice of the police. These make the round
of the stationers' shops, seizing all prohibited cards,
and very often, too, seizing other cards on their own
initiative and for their own use. To a stationer who
was privily selling us some prohibited cards, we put
the question, whether the police did not often enter
his shop, in order to seize whatever displeased them.
"What displeases them?" he replied. "No, no;
they seize more particularly whatever pleases them!"
Another merchant, who was summoned to attend at
the German police bureau in the Rue de l'Hôtel des
Monnaies, was assured by the commissioner that the
police had the right to take "everything that might
excite the patriotism of the Belgians." This official
put his own interpretation on Baron von der Goltz's
regulations with regard to patriotism.</p>

<p>Not far away, at St. Gilles, on Sunday the 14th
February, an under-officer brutally snatched away
the national flag which covered the coffin of a
Belgian soldier. Here is another example of individual
ideas as to the respect to be paid to
patriotism and piety.</p>

<p>While in Brussels the Germans prohibited only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the more recent Royal portraits, at Gand, in
February 1915, the commandant of the Magazine,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
in order to show his zeal, forbade the sale of any
portraits of the Royal Family, of whatever date or
nature.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Burgomaster of Gand has received the following letter,
the communal administration sending us a translation of the
same:&mdash;<br />

<p>I beg you again to draw the attention of all the booksellers,
stationers' shops, etc., by hand-bill or by means of the newspapers,
that they are forbidden under any circumstances to
display the portraits of the Royal Family of Belgium, either
in the windows or in the interior of the shops.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The German persecutions were resumed with
renewed vigour on the approach of the 8th April,
the King's birthday. At Antwerp the Germans
took care to forbid, in advance, anything that
might have passed for a royalist manifestation;
but the inhabitants succeeded, none the less, under
their enemies' noses, in celebrating their Sovereign's
anniversary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
<p>Elsewhere the Germans, in their incorrigible meanness,
had a different inspiration. They suddenly
had an intuition that the communal administrations
of Brabant were going to dismiss the schools in
honour of the King. Immediately circulars were
distributed, forbidding the closing of the schools on
that day. But these ineffable blunderers had forgotten
one thing: namely, that the 8th of April fell
in the middle of the Easter holidays! Certain communes
permitted themselves the malicious delight of
inquiring of the Germans whether they must recall
the pupils for the 8th of April? The Germans, of
course, missed the irony of the situation, and replied
that it would not be necessary to resume the classes.
Their second letter contains a particularly delightful
sentence: "My will is merely that instruction shall
not be specially interrupted in honour of the anniversary
of H.M. the King of the Belgians." Another
example of the unshakable determination to respect
the Belgians' patriotism!</p>


<p><i>Obligation to Employ the German Language.</i></p>

<p>These letters are written in German. For that
matter, it has become a rule with our enemies to
write only in their own tongue, and often even in
German characters. Better still: at Liége and
Namur (<i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, 31st August, 1914) they
required the Belgians also to write in German. Yet
another way of respecting our patriotism!</p>


<p><i>The Belgian Army is our Enemy!</i></p>

<p>Far from making an effort to respect our feelings,
one would even imagine that they must make it a
point of honour (German honour) to wound our
loyalty. Thus, when they punish any one for rendering
service to the Belgians, instead of expressing
the matter simply, as we have done, they announce
that the Belgian is convicted of relations with the
enemy. They are speaking of their enemies. But
"the enemy" implies that the Belgian Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
or the Belgian army is the enemy of the Belgian
people.</p>

<p>Better still: they inform us, by means of placards,
that to aid the Belgian army is "treason." The
Belgian becomes a traitor by rendering a service
to his country! What a singular conception of
honour!</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Warning.</span></div>

<p>The military tribunals have lately been compelled to condemn
to hard labour for attempted treason a large number of Belgians,
who had assisted their compatriots subject to military service in

<p>I again warn [the public] against committing such crimes
against the German troops, in view of the severe penalties
which they will incur.</p>

<p><i>The "Brabançonne" Prohibited.</i></p>

<p>At Namur the <i xml:lang="fr">Brabançonne</i> was declared seditious
on the 23rd March, 1915. But a month later the
execution of the <i>first four verses</i> was declared to be
permissible. What did the Germans mean by that?
Let us remember that none of the known versions
of our national song (the two versions of Jenneval
and that of Rogier) consists of more than four verses.
Which, then, are those that our persecutors forbid?
In their rage for prohibition they have prohibited
something that does not exist!&mdash;unless they were
speaking of the verse invented by <i xml:lang="fr">La Libre Belgique</i>,
and published in its tenth issue. It would
be amusing if the German authorities had fallen into
a snare set by a prohibited newspaper!</p>

<p>In Brussels the Germans had not dared openly
to interdict the <i xml:lang="fr">Brabançonne</i>, as they did another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
national anthem which had, so to speak, the freedom
of the city of Brussels: we mean the <i xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>
(placard of the 27th March, 1915). Never did one
hear the <i xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i> so often as after the Germans
forbade us to sing or play it; only it was now
whistled. So, as might have been expected, whistling
the <i xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i> was made a crime. As for the
<i xml:lang="fr">Brabançonne</i>, it was prohibited in an underhand
sort of way. It used to be sung every day in a
school in Brussels; but two German soldiers of
the Landsturm, who were guarding a neighbouring
railway, heard it, and felt offended. Hence a letter
to the communal authorities, demanding that the
national anthem should be sung or played with
more discretion. It is now seldom played save in
the churches: at High Mass on Sunday and the
funeral services for soldiers.</p>


<p><i>The National Anniversary of July 21st.</i></p>

<p>In July 1915 the people of Brussels hit on a new
method of celebrating the national anniversary of
the 21st July. Since our tyrants would obviously
forbid us to fly our flag at half-mast, in token of
our being for the time in mourning for our country,
a number of shopkeepers announced, by means of a
small printed notice, that "the shop would be
closed on Wednesday, the 21st July." The Germans
were displeased; moreover, they issued a decree
forbidding all demonstrations.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="right"><span class="smcap">21st July.</span></div>

<div class="center"><i>Order of the Governor of Brussels dated 18th July, 1915.</i></div>

<p>I warn the public that on the 21st July, 1915, demonstrations
of all kinds are expressly and severely prohibited.</p>

<p>Meetings, processions, and the decoration of public and private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
buildings also come under the application of the above prohibition.</p>

<p>Offenders will be punished by a term of imprisonment not
exceeding three months and a fine which may amount to as
much as 10,000 marks, or by one of these penalties to the
exclusion of the other.</p></blockquote>

<p>They also announced, by means of the newspapers
in their pay, <i xml:lang="fr">Le Bruxellois</i> and <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique</i>,
that the closing of the shops might be regarded as
a demonstration. Their pains were wasted. On
the morning of the 21st the shops and cafés remained
closed; in private houses the shutters were
not opened. In all Brussels only a few taverns
were open&mdash;taverns frequented by the Germans,
which a Belgian would never compromise himself
by entering. All that day it was a comforting and
impressive spectacle to see the crowd, in its Sunday
clothes, grave and deeply affected, with never one
uplifted voice, passing along the streets of closed
houses. Never had the like been seen in Brussels.
No one would have dared to hope for such unanimity
of feeling after eleven months of occupation. The
Germans were raging. They brought out troops,
who, with bayonet and cannon, occupied the principal
public squares; they ran an armoured motor-car
up and down the most frequented streets; they
dragged artillery along the avenues surrounding the
city. But they did not succeed in fomenting the
slightest disturbance; the Brussels public was too
firmly determined to preserve its dignity and its
tranquillity.</p>

<p>In all the churches the <i xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> was replaced by
a High Mass, followed by the playing of the
<i xml:lang="fr">Brabançonne</i>; the latter was sung in chorus by the
congregation, who were moved to tears.</p>

<p>The comic note was struck by the Germans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Suddenly, in the afternoon, motor-cars began to
hustle the crowds that had gathered; they bore
red placards, which were immediately pasted up,
announcing that the cafés, cinema-halls, etc., were
to be closed at 8 p.m. Now all these establishments
had been closed since the morning. The
Germans must have lost their heads to make so
grotesque an exhibition of themselves.</p>

<p>As a sort of reprisal, the authorities suspended
the two newspapers which had not appeared on the
21st July: <i xml:lang="fr">Le Quotidien</i> and <i xml:lang="fr">L'Écho de la Presse</i>.
Immediately <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique</i>, which had appeared,
suspended itself, in order to produce a belief that
it was not German! As for the <i xml:lang="fr">Bruxellois</i>, it said
not a word of the striking demonstration of the
21st.</p>

<p>In other Belgian towns the shops were closed.
In Antwerp more than the shops were closed; the
bureau of German passports, in the Place Verte,
announced, by means of two written notices, in
German and Flemish, that it was closed for the
21st July. The Germans were trying to repeat
the trick of the ivy-leaf. In vain, however, since
the 21st was to occur only once!</p>

<p>At Gand the Germans forbade the closing of the
shops. And the latter were all open. But in many
windows one saw, instead of the usual display of
goods, a group of articles which comprised a bucket
of water, a scrubbing-brush, and a chamois leather,
with an inscription: "Cleaning To-day."</p>


<p><i>The Anniversary of the 4th August.</i></p>

<p>We must suppose that the unanimity with which
the houses of Brussels were kept shut up touched
the Germans in a sore place, for they prohibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the repetition of their manifestation on the
4th August, the anniversary of their entrance into
Belgium.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Notice.</span></div>

<p>I warn the population of the Brussels district that on the
4th August any demonstration, including the decoration of
houses by means of flags and the wearing of emblems as a
demonstration is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>All gatherings will be dispersed regardless by the armed
forces.</p>

<p>Also I order that on the 4th August all the shops, as well as
cafés, restaurants, taverns, theatres, cinemas, and other establishments
of the same kind shall be closed after 8 o'clock in the
evening (German time). After 9 o'clock in the evening (German
time) only persons having a special written authorization emanating
from a German authority may remain in or enter the
streets.</p>

<p>Persons contravening these orders will be punished by a maximum
imprisonment of five years and a fine which may amount
to 10,000 marks, or one of these penalties to the exclusion of the
other.</p>

<p>The shops and establishments beforementioned which, as a
demonstration, shall close during the day of the 4th August will
remain closed for a considerable period of time.</p>

<i>1st August, 1915.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The placard announcing these prohibitions forbade
us to deck our houses with flags! Flags, good God!
Who then would have dreamed of flying flags in
commemoration of the rupture of an international
pact! At the most the people of Brussels had
intended to wear in the buttonhole a little "scrap
of paper." But the wearing of emblems was forbidden.</p>

<p>What the Germans did not think of forbidding
was the little demonstration of sympathy which
they received on the evening of the 4th. In conformity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
with the order, all doors were closed at
20 hours (9 o'clock German time). But in
several of the popular quarters of Brussels the
inhabitants were no sooner indoors than the upper
windows were thrown open, and a deafening concert
issued forth, in which phonographs, alarm clocks,
and saucepan-lids were predominant. The patrols
demanded the closing of the windows; but the
people climbed on the roofs to continue their
<i>charivari</i> there. The military commandant was
not pleased. It took him only five days to think
of an appropriate punishment.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Official Communication.</span></div>

<p>M. Maurice Lemonnier, acting burgomaster of the City of
Brussels, has just had posted the following communication:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>To the Inhabitants of the Rue de l'Escalier and the Rue du Dam</i>:</p>

<p>"I place before you the translation of an extract from a letter

<p>... Even if I am willing to recognize that the Administration
of the City endeavoured, by means of its organs, to obtain the
application of the prescribed measures on the 4th of this month,
there yet remains the fact that in two streets isolated individuals
were guilty, in a demonstrative manner, of gross misconduct
toward the German patrols.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that it has not been possible to discover
the persons individually guilty; consequently nothing is left me
to do but to take measures against the streets in which the
offences were committed.</p>

<p>Consequently I order the following as regards the two streets,
Rue de l'Escalier and Rue du Dam:</p>

<p>From Monday, the 9th of this month, and for the space of
fourteen days, that is to say, until the 23rd of this month
inclusively:</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A. All business houses and cafés will be closed after 7 o'clock
in the evening (German time).</p>

<p>B. After 9 o'clock in the evening (German time) no one must
be found out of doors, in the street. After that time all windows
giving on the street must be closed.</p>

<p>It is incumbent on the city to communicate the foregoing to
the inhabitants of these streets, to apply the aforementioned
measures, and to exercise a strict supervision in order that they
may be observed.</p>

<p>Also I beg you to see that these streets are sufficiently lighted,
until 11 o'clock at night (German time).</p>

<p>Moreover, I shall have these streets inspected by German
patrols. If on this occasion fresh offences are committed against
the German patrols, these latter will make use of their weapons.</p>

<p>Our tyrants appeared greatly to fear popular
demonstrations. The people of Liége had planned
to honour, on the 6th August, in the cemetery, the
soldiers who died for their country during the
defence of the city in August 1914. Immediately
the Germans made public their restrictive measures.</p>

ceremonies will take place at the tombs of the soldiers
killed in combat.</p>

<p>"I beg you to bring the foregoing to the notice of the population.</p>

<p>"I particularly insist that, during the visit to the tombs, or in
case of participation in the military ceremonies, no demonstrative

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The people of Liége retorted by putting their
shops in mourning, and on the 6th August it was
an impressive spectacle to see the shop-windows
throughout the centre of Liége hung with deep
violet.</p>


<p><i>School Inspection by the Germans.</i></p>

<p>In the schools the children were for a long time
able to sing <i xml:lang="fr">La Brabançonne</i> on the sly; but this
was not to last. The German authorities passed a
decree against Germanophobe demonstrations in the
schools.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Order.</span></div>

<div class="center"><i>Article First.</i></div>

<p>The members of the teaching staff, school managers and

be punished by imprisonment for a maximum term of one year.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Article Second.</i></div>

<p>The German authorities have the right to enter all classes and

<p>Our children will have to unlearn the national
anthem, which, in the present circumstances, is
evidently Germanophobe; and the teachers of
history, too, must keep a watch upon their words.
During the French lesson there must be no more
recitations of Andrieux' <i xml:lang="fr">Le Meunier de Sans-Souci</i>.
It may even be necessary to make deletions in the
Latin classics; for one can see the military tribunals
inflicting severe penalties on Tacitus, for even in his
days <i xml:lang="la">Gallos certare pro libertate, Batavos, pro gloria,
Germanos ad prædam</i> (The Gauls fight for liberty,
the Batavians for glory, the Germans for pillage).
Another Latin author who would certainly be proscribed
is Velleius Paterculus; he states in his
Roman History: <i xml:lang="la">At illi (Germani), quod nisi
expertus vix credat, in summa feritate versutissimi
natumque mendacio genus</i> (The Germans ally an
extreme ferocity to the greatest knavery; they are a
race born to lie; and one must have mingled with
them to believe this). Velleius Paterculus was a
good observer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The morality&mdash;or immorality&mdash;of this long series
of broken engagements, which might be indefinitely
prolonged, has had the result that no one can any
longer put his trust in Germany. None the less
does Germany continue to make promises, and is
even annoyed and irritated when one doubts her
word. Thus the Chancellor said, in a speech
delivered to the Reichstag on the 23rd May, 1915,
at the time of the negotiations with Italy:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Germany had given her word that the concessions
offered [by Germany] should be actually
accorded [by Austria]<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>; consequently there could
no longer be any reason for distrust." Italy, strong
in the experience acquired by Belgium, decided, on
the other hand, that there was reason for distrust
from the moment Germany pledged her word; and
accordingly she broke off negotiations in order to
declare war.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<h3>C.&mdash;Incitements to Disunion.</h3>

<p><i xml:lang="la">Divide et impera</i> ("Divide in order to rule") is
a maxim which has largely inspired the Germans
in their relations with the Belgians. They therefore
do their utmost to divide the nation from its King,
to excite the Belgians one against another, and
finally to kindle discord between our Allies and
ourselves.</p>

<p>We have just seen by what unjustifiable methods,
after promising to respect our patriotism, they
proceeded systematically (as they do all things)
to thwart our sentiments of fidelity to our King
and our nationality. Not content with opposing&mdash;sometimes
openly, sometimes with hypocrisy&mdash;all
our loyalist manifestations, they endeavour to embroil
us with our Sovereigns.</p>


<p><i>Incitements to Disloyalty.</i></p>

<p>While they accuse the Belgian nation of having
sold itself to the Triple Entente, they hold the
King personally responsible for this "conspiracy."
Having become the "valet" or the "slave" of
England, the Sovereign could not accept the friendly
hand which the Kaiser tendered him on two occasions&mdash;the
2nd and the 9th of August, 1914.</p>

<p>At Antwerp the Germans alone appear to have
heard the absurd declaration, that he vowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
"die in the city with his last soldiers." Then
he betrays his army and "takes to flight, amid the
maledictions of his subjects," deserting them for
those that seduced him.</p>

<p>Then we have him on the Yser, the melancholy
king "abandoned by God." He would ask nothing
better than to conclude peace. But England holds
him still in her toils, and prevents him from accomplishing
this wise project. It is <i xml:lang="fr">Le Réveil</i>, that
peculiarly truthful newspaper of Düsseldorf, which
reveals this sinister exploit of Albion. The <i xml:lang="de">Hamburger
Nachrichten</i> receives the same report from
Brussels.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">King Albert wishes to make Peace.</span></div>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Hamburg</span>, <i>14th November, 1914</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>From Brussels the <i xml:lang="de">Hamburger Nachrichten</i> hears from a very
reliable source that the report is confirmed which states that
serious differences exist between Belgium and England&mdash;that is,
that all personal relations are interrupted between King Albert
and the British Staff.</p>

<p>The King desires an understanding with Germany, which Great
Britain is endeavouring by all means to prevent.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="de">Vossische Zeitung</i>, 15th November, 1914.)<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The propagandist pamphlet <i xml:lang="de">Lüttich</i> is less severe
to our Sovereign, since it invokes, as an extenuating
circumstance, his "blindness, which verges on
stupidity." Incommensurable pride or imbecility&mdash;such
are the characteristics of King Albert! Do
these paladins of tact and delicacy show any greater
respect for our Queen? Be sure they do not! An
article on King Albert and the Triple Entente, in
the <i xml:lang="de">Deutsche Soldatenpost</i> of the 10th October, 1914,
a newspaper intended both for the troops and the
Belgian public, states: "From the outset the Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
was initiated into the King's plans. She has not
uttered a single word of reproach for the horrible
brutalities of which the principal victims were
innocent young German girls in Brussels and
Antwerp."</p>

<p>Well, we know that none of these "proofs" have
shaken our fidelity. Despite all prohibitions, despite
all the fines imposed, thousands of copies of the
portraits of the King in the midst of his troops,
and of the Queen, our dear little Queen, tending
the wounded, are sold every day of the year. The
patriotism of the Belgians is certainly incurable!</p>


<p><i>The Walloons incited against the Flemings.</i></p>

<p>So the Germans sought a new device. As they
could not cause disunion between the people and
the Sovereign, they tried to sow dissension between
the citizens themselves, by envenoming the problem
of language and reviving political rancour.</p>

<p>At first they exploited, in the most virulent manner,
the Flemish-Walloon conflict. As in all countries in
which several tongues are spoken, there is naturally
in Belgium a struggle between the Flemings, who
speak a Germanic language, and occupy the northern
portion of the country, and the Walloons, who speak
a Latin tongue, and occupy the southern provinces.
But this conflict, however lively it may have been,
has never touched the foundations of our national
conscience, and we have always felt ourselves
Belgians before everything.</p>

<p>At the outset, confesses Herr Kurd von Strantz,
the Germans did not realize what profit they might
derive from the antagonism of races in Belgium: an
antagonism which they believed to be profound, but
which was only skin-deep. Since the month of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
August, however, they have been trying to make up
for lost time; they no longer lose a single occasion
to excite the Flemings against the Walloons, and in
particular they seek to make the latter believe that
the Flemings already entertain feelings of sympathy
towards their executioners.</p>

<p>Only two months after the occupation of the
capital the Germans, organizing their conquest,
attempted to win over the Flemings by feigning to
espouse their grievances and by exploiting their racial
relationship, in order to divide them from their
Walloon fellow-citizens. Suddenly, in the official
communiqués, Flemish took the place until then
occupied by French, and the German newspapers
began to display a touching sympathy for their
"Flemish brothers," and for their country and their
art. We did not even need to read the article
published by the <i xml:lang="nl">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant</i> on
the 11th December (which was seen by M. Paul
Hymans), in order to divine, at the root of these
sudden and simultaneous manifestations, the orders
issued by the German official circles.</p>

<p>For it was not thus during the first weeks of the
occupation. Then correspondence was permissible
only in French and German: Flemish was not tolerated.
The official notices were printed in French
and German only. Then, on the 25th August, the
Government placards appeared in German, French,
and Flemish. Finally, on the 1st October, Flemish
had the advantage of French. Although from
the standpoint of Belgian law the latter measure
was legal in the Brussels district, the by-law ordering
the cinema-houses to publish their programmes
in Flemish as well as French was not so; very
often the manager is innocent of Flemish, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Flemish programme is spelt in the most fantastic
manner. Absolutely illegal, too, is the by-law
compelling shopkeepers in Bruges and Ostend to
replace their French shop-signs by signs written in
Flemish. Still more galling was the outcome of a
certain trial at Tongres. Some young men, Flemings
and Walloons, were accused of the same offence.
They were inscribed on separate lists, according to
their origin. The Walloons were condemned to
severer penalties than those inflicted on the Flemings.
One sees the double object here: to mollify
the Flemings and to make the Walloons suspicious
of them. We may compare this with the fact
that the majority of the Flemish civil prisoners have
been repatriated, while the Walloons are still in
Germany.</p>

<p>However, the daily task of insinuation and persuasion
is undertaken by the German press. In the
first place it lays stress on the great affinity of character,
historical past, origin, and language between
the Germans and the Flemings (<i xml:lang="de">Düss. Gen. Anz.</i>, 4th
December, 1914). The Germans must humour the
Flemings and make friends with them. One reason
why it would not do to treat Belgium more harshly
(as had been demanded) is that there is a racial
relationship between a portion of the population and
that of Germany. There is no Belgian people (<i xml:lang="de">Voss.
Zeit.</i>, 1st March, 1915). Much is made of the distant
echoes of the linguistic quarrel (<i xml:lang="de">Voss. Zeit.</i>,
1st March, 1915; <i>K.Z.</i>, 18th March, 1915; <i xml:lang="de">Frankf.
Zeit.</i>, 24th March, 1915; Osswald, <i xml:lang="de">Zur Belgischen
Frage</i>).&mdash;The ill-feeling of the Flemings toward the
"purely Walloon" Belgian Government must be
fomented (<i xml:lang="de">Frankf. Zeit.</i>, 24th March, 1915), and
also their dislike of the Belgian press printed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
French tongue, both Government and press having
been long ago won over to France and the hatred of
Germany (<i>K.Z.</i>, 15th November, 1915). <i xml:lang="fr">La Croix
Rouge</i> is published in three languages, Flemish preceding
even German, and the French occupying only
the extreme right of the sheet; each number contains
only one <i xml:lang="fr">feuilleton</i>, and that is a novel in
Flemish. A little Flemish conversation manual&mdash;<i xml:lang="nl">Vlamischer
Sprachführer</i>&mdash;is published in Düsseldorf
for the use of Germans, and of soldiers in particular.
In order to compromise the Flemish, the
Germans pretend that well-known Flemings are
already working hand-in-hand with the German
administration. It is even stated that a pro-German
group of young Flemings exists (<i>K.Z.</i>,
18th March, 1915). In verse translations, the
<i xml:lang="nl">Dietsch</i> or <i xml:lang="nl">duitsch</i> of the Flemish poets is rendered
by "German," whereas these words signify simply
the Flemish or Dutch language (<i xml:lang="de">Lüttich</i>, p. 127;
<i xml:lang="de">Köln. Volksz.</i>, 25th January, 1915). Herr Karl
Lamprecht, the well-known historian, who knew
that his translation was dishonest, was one of those
who translated <i xml:lang="nl">dietsch</i> by "German" (<i xml:lang="de">Die Woche</i>,
No. 12, 1915). Better still, in the same article
Herr Lamprecht feigns to believe that by the expression
<i xml:lang="nl">Noord en Zuid</i> Emmanuel Hiel intended
to denote the Germans and the Flemings; whereas
he is speaking&mdash;and no confusion is possible&mdash;of the
Dutch (Noord-Nederlanders), and the Flemings
(Zuid-Nederlanders).</p>

<p>A short story by M. Maurice Sabbe was published
in the <i xml:lang="de">Berliner Tageblatt</i> on the 25th December,
1914, with an introduction which was peculiarly
compromising to the author's patriotic sentiments.
His extremely plain reply was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sketch we publish here deserves particular attention.
Maurice Sabbe is a scholar and a Flemish writer of repute,
who, during the bombardment of Malines, fled into Holland.
Sabbe knows Germany, thanks to a long residence at Weimar,
and the military situation has not succeeded in destroying his
feeling, which is exempt from prejudice, for Germany and Germanism.
He expresses his opinion with sympathy in the lectures
which he is delivering in Holland, and, in the same spirit, he has
addressed, through his translator, to a German journal, the
<i xml:lang="de">Berliner Tageblatt</i>, this short story of life in Malines, which
describes an episode of the war: the first contribution which,
coming from Belgium and written by a Belgian during the war,
has been destined to find publication in Germany.</p>

<p>I beg your hospitality for the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the November number (1914) of the review <i xml:lang="nl">Onze Eeuw</i> I
published a literary version of an episode of the bombardment of
Malines. A Dutch writer, M. E. Meier, requested my permission
for the publication of a translation of this sketch in a German
newspaper. I granted it him without hesitation and even with a
certain pleasure. My narrative emphasized the kindness and
magnanimity of my countrymen towards their enemies, and, at
a moment when the German press was accusing every Belgian of
being a franc-tireur, I thought myself fortunate to be able to
place a contrary example beneath the eyes of the German
public.</p>

<p>I left the choice of newspaper to my translator, and the
translation appeared in the Christmas number of the <i xml:lang="de">Berliner
Tageblatt</i>.</p>

<p>But here the plot thickens. Unknown to me, the editors of
the <i xml:lang="de">Berliner Tageblatt</i> prefaced my story with a notice highly
compromising to me. It asserts, in short, that I have German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
sympathies which the war has not succeeded in shaking, that I am
giving lectures in Holland in order to express these feelings, and
that I wrote my short story especially to be published in Germany!</p>

<p>The last assertion is already contradicted by the fact that
the sketch in question is a translation of the text which appeared
in a French review two months ago. As for my sentiments,
they are what they have always been, those of a Belgian unshakably
attached to his unhappy country and his noble King. These,
and no others, are the feelings I have expressed in my lectures in
Holland. My numerous auditors can testify to this.</p>

<p>You will give me a sensible pleasure, sir, by inserting this
letter, thus assisting me to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>

<p>This is only a detail in the conflict we are sustaining
against invading Germany, but it is a very
instructive detail, because it shows that before
accepting any assertion on the part of our oppressors
we must always ask ourselves how much of it is a
lie. The same question arises <i xml:lang="fr">à propos</i> of a letter
written by a Fleming living at Liége and speaking
"in the name of the Flemish population of Liége,"
which aspires to live under the German domination.
By the singularities of his syntax and his orthography
this Fleming from Liége can only be of German
origin (<i xml:lang="de">Düss. Gen. Anz.</i>, 11th February, 1915).</p>

<p>Once there was even a kind word spoken for the
Walloons, vindicating the dignity of their dialects,
which are by no means dependent on the French.
(It is true this bold assertion comes from Herr Kurd
von Strantz.)</p>


<p><i>Inciting the People against the Belgian Government.</i></p>

<p>On the other hand, they hope to detach the
Belgian people from its Government. Especially
during the siege of Antwerp did they heap effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
on effort of this kind. It was then greatly to their
interest to send as many troops as possible to the
Western front (so says Lieutenant-General Imhoff,
in his introduction to Delbrück's <i xml:lang="de">Der Deutsche
Krieg in Feldpostbriefen</i>, pp. 11 to 13). Now
hundreds of thousands of their men were delayed
in Belgium by the siege of Antwerp. At all costs
these had to be liberated in order to lengthen the
battle-front towards the north-west and the sea.
Towards the middle of September they did not
hesitate for the third time to make peace proposals
to the Government&mdash;proposals which were rejected
with disdain, as were the previous ones (pp. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>-<a href="#Page_51">1</a>).
After this repeated diplomatic failure they attempted
trickery, a speciality in which they shine to more
advantage. As they could not succeed in directly
influencing the leaders of Belgian politics, they
endeavoured to act on them indirectly through the
people. A newspaper was established, <i xml:lang="fr">L'Écho de
Bruxelles</i>, "for the general welfare," to which a
certain "Aristide" contributed. He professed to be
an occasional correspondent, although his articles
were really the pretext for issuing the paper.</p>

<p>In the first number he published a detestable
letter in which he called upon the Belgian Government
at all costs to make peace with Germany.
This proceeding was so improper that the <i>N.R.C.</i>
even, while reprinting the letter, could not refrain
from criticizing it harshly. In No. 4, which
appeared on the 4th October, 1914, and which
was entirely devoted to an attempt to cause mental
anxiety in the people of Brussels, he condemned
as unpatriotic "the man who does not rise up to
cry to the people of Antwerp that they must cease
from this sanguinary, disastrous, and useless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
struggle for a cause which is not ours." The
same accusation was made against "those divisional
Generals whom the laurels of General
Leman will not allow to sleep." "The laurels of
General Leman, great God!" he adds, and thereupon
he moves heaven and earth to prove the
notorious insufficiency of the valiant defender of
Liége. No, he says, "the true and only heroes of
this melancholy war in Belgium are those who
... have proposed to treat with Germany. These,
Ministers and generals, have given proof of courage
and wisdom, exposing themselves to the vengeance
of a mob over-excited by a system of lies and
delusions.... And the public will kick out these
French journalists and these hawkers of French
journals who for years have whispered hatred of
neighbour against neighbour, the latter being the
best customer Belgium possessed." We have cited
only the more scandalous portions of this article,
ignoring the merely ignoble passages.</p>

<p>While "Aristide" was endeavouring to influence
the civil population, aeroplanes were distributing
to the Belgian troops in Antwerp circulars, printed
in French, and in another language which had a
certain resemblance to Flemish; and these strange
handbills informed the Belgian soldiers that they
had been deceived by their officers and by the
authorities; that the Belgian army was fighting
for the British and the Russians, etc.</p>

already enormous power, and, above all, the interest of England,
whose perfidious avarice has given birth to this cruel and unheard-of
war. From the commencement your newspapers, paid

the battles which have followed, and this is still done every day.
Consider one of your army orders which affords fresh proof of
this. This is what it contains:</p>

<p>"You have been told that your comrades who are prisoners in
Germany have been forced to march against Russia beside our
soldiers." Yet your common sense must tell you that this would
be a measure quite impossible to execute. When the day comes
when your comrades who are prisoners return from our country
and tell you with how much benevolence they have been treated,
their words will make you blush for what your newspapers, and
your officers, have dared to tell you, in order to deceive you in
so incredible a manner. Every day of resistance makes you
sustain irreparable losses, while with the capitulation of Antwerp
you will be free from all anxiety. Belgian soldiers, you have
fought enough for the interests of the princes of Russia, for those
of the capitalists of perfidious Albion. Your situation is one to
despair of. Germany, who is fighting only for her life, has
destroyed two Russian armies. To-day no Russian is to be
found in our country. In France our troops are about to overcome
the last resistance. If you wish to rejoin your wives and
children, if you wish to return to your work, in a word, if you
wish for peace, put an end to this useless struggle, which is
ending only in your ruin. Then you will quickly enjoy all the
benefits of a favourable and perfect peace.</p>

<p>When examples of this circular were brought to
us in Brabant, we at first thought it was a hoax.
But we had to submit to the evidence; the idea
of this proclamation had really been conceived and
executed by the Germans.</p>

<p>After the fall of Antwerp the campaign continued.
Was it not necessary to prevent the Belgians from
going to join the Allies in the direction of Flanders?
With this end in view, the Germans attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
throw suspicion on the conduct of the Belgian
military authorities at the time of the taking of
Antwerp. It was again the <i xml:lang="fr">Écho de Bruxelles</i>
which was entrusted with the publication of the
first false news. Shortly after the accomplishment
of this pleasant task, the <i xml:lang="fr">Écho de Bruxelles</i>
disappeared for ever: doubtless it was no longer
required.</p>

<p>As for the defamatory libels which were uttered
in November and December, in order to incriminate
the conduct of the civil authorities of Antwerp, it
is not yet known by whom they were instigated,
worded, and distributed; but we have a reasonable
conviction that the Germans were not unaware of
them. In any case they did what they could to
profit by this disagreement, and they also did their
best&mdash;in vain&mdash;to revive the question when the
Belgians, by common accord, had settled their
differences.</p>

<p>But the Germans had not yet given up the idea
of fomenting conflicts among us. In an article
entitled <i xml:lang="de">Belgische Umstimmigkeiten</i> (Change of
Temper in Belgium) the <i xml:lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</i> of the
22nd November, 1914 (2nd morning edition) referred
to a telegram from Berlin which stated that news
received from Breda (according to the <i xml:lang="de">Berliner
Lokal-Anzeiger</i>) asserted that seven Belgian officers
had deserted and had there been interned. To
verify this was very difficult, the more so as in
November 1914 no postal or telegraphic communication
was permitted between Belgium and
Holland. The rest of the article informed us that
on the 5th November&mdash;a fortnight before their
desertion&mdash;these officers had received from King
Albert the Cross of the Order of Leopold: they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
had thus waited to desert until they had been
made the object of special distinction, which is at
least peculiar. And then, setting out from the
Yser, they crossed the German lines to be interned
at Breda, in Northern Brabant. Strange! strange!
And all this in order to inform us that these
officers, disheartened by the servile and treacherous
attitude of the King, refused again to send their
men into battle, for the sake of the English.</p>


<p><i>Inciting the Belgians against the English.</i></p>

<p>It will be remarked that the English always
receive a good share of the venomous slime which
the Germans, as M. Spitteler says, spit upon the
King, the Government, and the Belgian authorities.
"England&mdash;there is the enemy!" says the
<i xml:lang="de">Hassgesang Gegen England</i>&mdash;i.e. <i>Song of Hatred
of England</i>, the work of Herr Ernst Lissauer.</p>

<div class="poem">
<i>We love but with a single love,<br />
We hate but with a single hate;<br />
We have one foe, and one alone&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">England!</span><br />
</i>
</div>

<p>It would be tedious to mention all the innumerable
articles intended to arouse in us a hatred of England.
We may mention the opinion of Dr. Hedin, reproduced
on the placard of the 9th November, 1914;
the proclamation of Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria,
inserted, for our edification, in <i xml:lang="fr">Le Réveil</i> (29th
October), as well as the declaration imputed to the
Flemish "poet" Cyrid Buysse (placard of 12th
December, 1914). But these lovers of truth forgot
to announce, a few days later, that M. Buysse
denied the truth of the German declaration. A
mere instance of forgetfulness, no doubt, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the Amsterdam-Copenhagen-Berlin-Brussels route,
which was covered by the so-called declaration,
had suddenly grown too long for truth to travel by.</p>


<h3>D.&mdash;A Few Details of the Administration of Belgium.</h3>

<p>The preceding chapter has informed us how the
Germans bore themselves towards the inhabitants of
the territory occupied in conformity with&mdash;or rather
in contravention of&mdash;Articles 42-56 of the Hague
Convention. Treachery and untruthfulness are the
chief weapons employed by our enemies. We need
not return to the subject. We desire now merely to
refer to some details relating to the administration.
Details, we said; and in truth we shall consider
neither the financial administration of the country,
nor its judicial administration, nor its political
administration, nor any of the other great cog-wheels
essential to the life of a nation. We shall confine
ourselves to very simple facts which any one can
remark and understand.</p>


<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Present Prosperity in Belgium.</i></p>

<p>There is nothing of which the Germans are
more proud than their talent&mdash;real or illusory&mdash;for
organization. Accordingly they professed their intention
of re-establishing the normal state of affairs
in Belgium, in spite of the war, and they are
always informing the whole world that everything
has resumed its regular course in our country.</p>


<p><i>Assertions of the German Authorities.</i></p>

<p>Even in his inaugural proclamation (2nd September,
1914), von der Goltz took the trouble of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
informing us that work was to be resumed. But
the Germans had placed such impediments in the
way of inter-urban relations that all activities were
necessarily suspended. In October he accorded
"facilities of communication," as we were informed
by the announcement of the 15th, which meant
that "circulation" was no longer absolutely prohibited,
and that he who had the means to obtain
a passport, and could spend a day or two in procuring
it, would thereafter be authorized to travel
from Louvain to Malines, or from Namur to Liége.
As these measures, though so full of solicitude for
the general welfare, did not produce all the results
that were expected of them, the communal authorities
were advised to refuse relief to the unemployed
(6th November, 1914). Nothing came of that advice!</p>

<p>To the numerous obstacles already mentioned we
must add one other: the railway-workers and the
artisans employed in many of the foundries and
workshops of Belgium were perfectly well aware that
their labours would principally benefit the Germans,
so that by returning to their workshops they would
be committing an unpatriotic action. To overcome
this passive resistance the Germans multiplied their
proclamations in the industrial centres. It was
wasted effort.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Governor-General, in the
vain hope of galvanizing the labour organizations,
sent to Germany for well-known Socialists, who,
under the pretext of having a chat with the leaders
of the trades unions, were really to inculcate the
idea that it was their duty to urge a resumption
of work. The visits of the German Socialists have
been described by M. Dewinne, of Brussels, a militant
worker, in the Parisian journal <i xml:lang="fr">L'Humanité</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Infatuated as the Germans might be, they could
hardly delude themselves as to the failure of their
attempts at subornation. This did not prevent
Baron von Bissing from issuing declarations dealing
with the situation which were truly touching in
their sincerity.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">News Published by the German General Government.<br />
Normal Situation in Belgium.</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Vienna</span>, <i>19th December</i>.&mdash;The Sofia correspondent of the
<i xml:lang="de">Neue Freie Presse</i> has had an interview with Field-Marshal
von der Goltz, who declared: "The situation in Belgium is
entirely normal. The Belgian population is acquiring the
conviction that the Germans are anything but cruel."</p>

<div class="right">

<p><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <i>15th December</i>.&mdash;To the correspondent of the <i xml:lang="de">Hamburger
Korrespondent</i>, the new Governor-General in Belgium,
General Baron von Bissing, has made the following declarations:
I wish to maintain order and tranquillity in this country, which
has become the base of operations for our troops. Our army
must know that order prevails behind it, so that it may always
give its attention freely only to what lies before it. I hope also
that I shall succeed, hand in hand with the civil administration,
in doing a great deal for the economic situation. When the
Emperor appointed me Governor-General he charged me, with
particular insistence, to do everything to assist the weak in
Belgium, and to encourage them.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">The General Government in Belgium.</span><br />
</div></blockquote>


<p><i>The Parasitical Exploitation of Belgium admitted
by Germany.</i></p>

<p>But, you may ask, had not Germany other than
military reasons for wishing to revive the economic
life of Belgium? A semi-official article in the
<i xml:lang="de">Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</i>, which was
brought to our cognizance by the <i xml:lang="de">Düsseldorfer
General-Anzeiger</i> of the 30th December, 1914,
informs us upon this point. The article emanates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
from Governmental circles in Brussels, probably
from the immediate <i xml:lang="fr">entourage</i> of the Governor-General.
Its object is to reply to the complaints
formulated in Germany, according to which the
authorities deal too gently with the Belgians.
Instead of trying to revive Belgian industry, it
would be better, say the critics, to crush it completely,
in order to suppress future competition:
on the other hand, it is claimed that the contribution
of 480 million frs. is insufficient to reduce us to
impotence, and that we ought to have been more
severely "squeezed." The German Government in
Belgium defends itself briskly against the reproach of
sentimentality; it asserts that it has never allowed
itself to be guided by an exaggerated mildness (and
we are ready to declare that on this point at least
its assertions maybe credited!). It would surely not
be very intelligent, it protests, to strangle outright
a country so ill-directed. Would it not be preferable
to exploit Belgium scientifically, so as to
make her yield as much as possible? The argument
amounts to this: do not let us kill the goose that
lays the golden eggs; but of course it is understood,
although one need not express it explicitly,
that when it is no longer in condition to lay, we
shall not hesitate to cut its throat.</p>


<p><i>The Tenfold Tax on Absentees.</i></p>

<p>Many Belgians have left the country. That is
easily understood. Those who were present at the
massacres of Visé, Louvain, Dinant, Termonde ...
hastened, in their terror, to abandon those haunts of
horror. Those who lived in the towns left intact,
such as Brussels and Gand, but who heard people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
talk of the massacres and the burnings, had also only
one idea: to fly before the arrival of the Germans.
Even those Belgians who did not leave at the outset
eventually grew weary of the insupportable vexations
inflicted on us by the authorities. Others took flight
because they knew themselves to be threatened with
imprisonment. Moreover, many of those who had
means had prudently retired to foreign countries, to
the great fury of the Germans; there was no way of
getting at these "bad patriots," as it seems a German-Swiss
journal called them (<i>K.Z.</i>, 11th February,
1915); no way of forcing them to pay war-taxes.
Moreover, it was these <i xml:lang="fr">émigrés</i> who should have kept
alive the industries <i xml:lang="fr">de luxe</i>; finally, they were conspiring
together abroad, and rendering services to
the Belgian Government at Havre. If only they
could be forced to return! Our enemies accepted
with enthusiasm an unlucky proposal&mdash;made by
certain communal administrations and immediately
withdrawn by them&mdash;that the absent persons should
be subjected to a special tax, equal to ten times the
personal tax. The communal councils which conceived
the idea of this tax immediately realized its
illegality, but Baron von Bissing seized the occasion
which this afforded him of persecuting the <i xml:lang="fr">émigrés</i>.
He published, on the 16th January, a special decree
on the subject of the "additional extraordinary tax
upon absentees" (<i xml:lang="de">Belg. All.</i>). It may be remarked
that the tax touches only those who possess a certain
competence.</p>

<p>Here are two facts which show how far life was
normal in Belgium in the spring of 1915, and how
far the Belgian workers were delighted to place
themselves at the service of Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Railway Traffic in Belgium.</i></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) An article in the <i xml:lang="de">Düsseldorfer General-Anzeiger</i>
of the 19th April, 1915 (morning), asserts that the
traffic on the Belgian railways is beginning to revive;
indeed, says the writer, there are thirty-eight trains
daily leaving the Gare du Nord in Brussels. He
exaggerates slightly. Six weeks later, when traffic
had become more active, a table, dated the 30th May,
1915, which appeared in the "Belgian" newspaper
<i xml:lang="fr">L'Information</i>, gave the movements of trains in the
Gare du Nord and Gare du Midi of Brussels for the
month of June. We find that only thirty-four departures
are given for the two stations. Thirty-four
trains in June 1915&mdash;and in June 1914 there were
292. Compare the figures.</p>


<p><i>Trouble with the Artisans of Luttre.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The insufficiency of the number of trains is in
reality one of the things that most embarrasses the
German authorities (see <i xml:lang="de">Frank. Zeit.</i>, 16th January,
1915, first morning edition). In and about the railway
workshops, for example, on the sidings at
Luttre, there are hundreds of locomotives out of
repair and waiting for attention. But the workers
employed in these shops do not intend to work for
the Germans. In vain do the latter protest that
engines repaired by the Belgians shall be employed
only for Belgian traffic. What guarantee have they
that the locomotives will not serve to transport
German troops, or munitions intended to kill our
brothers? Is it not a matter of public notoriety
that a contract is merely a scrap of paper?</p>

<p>To enable the workers to resist the solicitations of
the Germans the necessary relief has been distributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
for the maintenance of their families. The Germans
know very well that it is this money which prevents
them from subduing the workers to their will. They
therefore proceed with the utmost severity against
the persons whose duty it is to distribute the relief.
Early in April 1915 they imprisoned thirty of the
notables of Luttre, Nivelles, and the neighbourhood,
whom they accused of assisting the working staff of
the Luttre workshops. A German official declared
that the prisoners had been arrested neither by the
civil authority nor the military, and that they would
not proceed to trial. At the same time the administrations
of the communes neighbouring upon Luttre
were forced to display a proclamation requiring the
men to resume work. Among the promises made to
those who should resume work was one that the
prisoners should be liberated. So thirty notables
were thrown into prison, and kept there, in order to
force Belgian artisans to work for the Germans!
When it was found that in spite of everything the
men would not return to the shops, the prisoners
were sentenced to undergo various punishments, the
maximum term of imprisonment being three months.
As for the recalcitrant workers, many were sent to
Germany, where they were treated in the most
inhuman fashion.</p>


<p><i>Traffic Suppressed at Malines.</i></p>

<p>At the construction shops of Malines the Germans
went a different way to work. There again workers
were needed to repair railway material. Three
hundred were called for. As they did not present
themselves their addresses were obtained, and one
fine morning soldiers called at their houses and
<i xml:lang="la">manu militari</i> led them to the shops. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the men folded their arms and persisted in doing
nothing. The Germans had to let them go.</p>

<p>How to obtain their submission? The Germans
threatened to suppress all traffic in Malines. A
singular fashion of punishing workless men who
refuse to betray their country, especially after declaring
that the only "guilty" persons were those
who had organized the collective refusal to work!
(<i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique</i>, 9th June, 1915). But, in accordance
with the juridical principle that "the innocent must
suffer with the guilty," our enemies punished the
market-gardeners of the Malines district and prevented
them from sending their cabbages and rhubarb
and peas and asparagus to market.</p>

<p>After the lapse of some days the Governor-General
removed the prohibition. But he did not wish it to
seem that he had repented of his decision, however
unreasonable the latter might be, so to keep himself
in countenance he posted up a statement that a sufficient
number of workers had resumed work (placard
of 10th June, 1915). However, the Baron von
Bissing cannot have been ignorant of the fact that
none of the strikers of the Malines workshops had
returned; the only workers whom the Germans had
been able to recruit were some unemployed persons
from Lierre, Boom, and Duffel, who had never set
foot in the shops before. As they could not be
employed in the manufacture of railway material,
they were made to dig trenches in the direction
of Wavre-Ste Catherine and Duffel.</p>

<p>The workers whom the soldiers led to the shops
by force related that their escort begged them not
to resume work, because they would then be obliged
to leave Malines and to go to the Yser, a prospect
which inspired them with the keenest terror.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The Germans' Talent for Organization.</i></p>

<p>"The industrial and commercial prosperity" which
Belgium is at present enjoying is, of course, due to
the Germans' incontestable spirit of organization.
"This sense of discipline and order, which the
foreigner calls militarism" (<i xml:lang="de">Voss. Zeit.</i>, 12th February,
1915, morning), has enabled the officers of
the reserve to accomplish such wonderful things
that Herr Oswald F. Schütte, correspondent of the
<i>Chicago Daily News</i> (see <i>K.Z.</i>, 6th May, 1915, first
morning edition) can scarcely find the words to
describe them. "We understand," adds the same
journalist, "that the Government at Havre does not
look with a favourable eye upon the success with
which the German administration has once more
made life worth living in Belgium."</p>

<p>They are certainly something to be wondered at,
the officers who are administering our country.
Would you have proof? The Belgian officials of
the Bridges and Highways Department refused to
obey the Germans, so that the latter appointed
their engineer officers to direct the work of repairing
roads. But the work was naturally carried out
by Belgian contractors. On macadamized roads the
breaking of stones, which formerly cost from 18 to
22 centimes per square metre (about 2d. per square
yard), now costs 60 to 65 centimes. Good business,
you will say, for the contractors and their men.
But no!&mdash;the difference goes into the pockets of
the officers.</p>


<p><i>Conflict between Authorities.</i></p>

<p>This method of procedure naturally results in
conflicts between the various administrations. We
have already related (p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>) that the city of Brussels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
was condemned to pay a fine of half a million francs
because the civilians and the soldiers were in disagreement.
Muddles of this kind testify to something
quite different from a brilliant talent for
organization, which the Germans would have us
believe is the distinguishing mark of their administration.</p>


<p><i>Suppression of the Bureau of Free Assessment.</i></p>

<p>In order to give the impression that they alone
are capable of re-starting the economic machine in
Belgium, the Germans begin by dislocating the
existing machinery. Thus, a group of advocates
and surveyors created a bureau for the gratuitous
assessment of the damage caused by the war to
real estate. This body was working to the general
satisfaction, when suddenly, in March 1915, the
Germans decided to take its place. Now observe
their methods. The applicant who wishes the
damage suffered by his property to be estimated
has to begin by paying a provisional deposit, after
which he finds that the costs of the assessment have
to be paid out of his own pocket. What this really
comes to is this: the Germans, having burned a
house and reduced its owner to poverty, demand
that the latter shall pay in advance for the
evaluation of the damage done.</p>


<p><i>The Belgian Red Cross Committee Suppressed.</i></p>

<p>Another example of the suppression of a body
working in a normal manner. As soon as they
occupied Brussels the Germans began to meddle
in the doings of the Directing Committee of the
Red Cross Society, and appointed a delegate to
the Society. They then tried to force the Red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Cross to exceed its duties, which were clearly
specified by the international convention known
as the <i>Convention for the Amelioration of the
Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in
the Field</i>. Neither in the text of the Convention
of 1869, nor in that of the Convention of 1906, is
there any question of other patients than soldiers
wounded during hostilities. Doubtless it is a matter
for praise if the Red Cross of each country should
extend its action to needs existing in time of peace;
in Belgium, for example, the Red Cross has organized
ambulances in the International Exhibitions.
But it is none the less true that its
essential mission, and the only mission foreseen
by the International Convention, is to ameliorate
the condition of soldiers who are victims of warfare.
It was therefore an abuse of the Red Cross
to impose other aims upon it; to compel it, for
example, to organize "the relief and support of
women by means of labour." The Red Cross
of Belgium decided, with abundant reason, that
it could not in time of war assume novel functions,
nor, above all, could it set apart for the
same sums of money which were largely derived
from private subscriptions entrusted to it for the
succour of the wounded; it therefore refused to
involve itself. After lengthy negotiations the
Governor-General suspended the Belgian managing
committee from its functions, and seized the funds.</p>

<p>We should mention that the Central Administration
of the Red Cross, sitting in Geneva, decided
that the Brussels Committee was in the right.</p>

<p>Attempting to justify their illegal attitude, the
German authorities established a special journal,
<i xml:lang="fr">La Croix Rouge, Bulletin officiel de la Croix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Rouge de Belgique</i>, printed in Flemish, French,
and German. This journal continues to pretend
that the Belgian Committee was legally dissolved,
as it would not "assist the people in the present
melancholy situation."</p>

<p>In vain did the Germans endeavour to put the
world off the scent as to their intentions. They
knew perfectly well that the National Committee
of Relief and Alimentation patronized and subsidized
without distinction all the benevolent undertakings
which applied to it (p. <a href="#Page_176">176</a>). The real
aim of our enemies is to supplant the National
Committee. This committee is a private institution
in which they have no voice, which greatly
annoys them; at most they can endeavour to make
it believed that the revictualling of Belgium is
effected with their assistance. But this, as may
be supposed, is not enough for them; their real aim,
their unavowed object, is to obtain entire control
of the National Committee, in order to exercise
there also their talent for organization&mdash;or,
more precisely, their talent for peculation. The
40,000,000 frs. per month does not sate their
appetite. What an indefinite perspective of fleshpots
could they only lay hands on the revictualling
of Belgium!</p>

<p>The whole affair of the Red Cross was conducted
with annoying duplicity&mdash;annoying even to us, who
nevertheless were beginning to grow accustomed to
their campaign of lies. For months there were
negotiations between the Belgium Managing Committee
and the German authorities, represented by
the Graf von Hatzfeld-Trachenberg. At each
interview the latter brought forth fresh demands on
the part of the Governor-General, but he always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
added that he was acting reluctantly, and that in
his opinion the demands were unjustified; only, of
course, he had to obey. (This is, by the way, the
classic procedure. Whenever a German commits a
dirty action he entrenches himself behind discipline.)
These lame discussions lasted until the 16th April,
1915; upon a final refusal on the part of the Belgian
Committee to exceed its proper functions, Graf von
Hatzfeld-Trachenberg gave orders for the decree of
dissolution to be read.</p>


<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The Belgian Attitude toward the Germans.</i></p>

<p>Our enemies spread the report that the relations
between occupants and inhabitants were greatly
improving, and that the Belgians had abandoned
their provocative attitude, which was so unpleasant
at the outset of the war. They also asserted that
by the end of October the people at Antwerp had
ceased to display any antipathy towards them
(<i xml:lang="de">Köln. Volksz.</i>, 30th October, 1914, morning edition).<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
But, in truth, they flattered themselves when they
stated that the Belgium people regarded them with
glances full of hatred. Hatred? No; merely
glances full of disdain, when by chance one could
not do otherwise than gaze at them; but, as a rule,
the Belgians turn their eyes away, as they turn their
backs upon German music.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>
<p>At Liége, in Brussels and Antwerp, and at
Malines, when an officer addresses a Belgian the
latter pretends not to hear (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 20th October,
1914, morning edition), or simply states that he has
not time to speak to the other; or he replies in
Flemish; or else, having affected to listen to him
with all the marks of the most exquisite politeness,
he leaves the German standing still without replying
a word. The ladies more often reply, but it is only
to beg the Germans not to speak to them. The
officer who asks his way is almost certain to be sent
in a contrary direction; while he who climbs on the
platform of a tram finds that all the passengers
immediately turn their backs upon him; and this
rotation is executed with the regularity and precision
of a reflex movement. The officer who begs a
a passer-by to lend him his cigar that he may obtain
a light, sees the other disgustedly throw away the
cigar which an enemy has touched. The child
whom an officer condescends to caress pushes away
his hand with an indignant expression, and makes
the ugliest grimace he knows of. In short, they
are the objects of universal detestation.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be said that this attitude is peculiar
to the towns which have been little or not at all
affected by the war. But no! In localities which
were largely burned down, such as Aerschot, Eppeghem,
Dinant, and Louvain, the population behaves
in a manner even more characteristic. At Dinant
the children sing at the tops of their voices a
<i xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i> with new words, expressly anti-German,
in which a good deal is said about pigs. At Louvain
some officers who used to amuse themselves with a
phonograph which reproduced the record of the song
<i xml:lang="il">Gloria, Vittoria</i>, had to give up using it in June
1915,  because the passers-by accompanied the refrains
with other words: <i xml:lang="il">Gloria, Italia</i>. At Eppeghem
and Aerschot the children play at soldiers, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Belgian police bonnets on their heads, yelling <i xml:lang="fr">La
Brabançonne</i>. One would say the sight of those
calcined ruins, far from intimidating the Belgians,
as the butchers had hoped, only whets their rebellious
spirits, and that the certainty of final
success has completely effaced, in the soul of the
people, the memory of the terrors experienced at the
time of the burnings and killings.</p>

<p>Not only is the Belgian population far from
fraternizing with them, as they try to make the
world believe, but it neglects no opportunity of
proving that it is animated by very different feelings.
It must be confessed that when we openly wear the
Belgian or American colours it is with a double
object: to advertise our attachment to our country,
or our gratitude to America, and also to make the
Germans furious. The little celluloid portraits of
the King and Queen which one wears in the buttonhole
serve the same purposes. After the Germans
had imprisoned M. Max in a German prison many
people displayed his portrait. This was extremely
disagreeable to our enemies (<i xml:lang="de">Köln. Volksz.</i>, 30th September,
1914, morning edition); but precisely for
that reason people persisted in wearing the little
medallion until the German police demanded its
forcible removal.</p>

<p>When the Governor-General, in the interviews
which he granted the correspondents of the <i>N.A.Z.</i>
and the <i xml:lang="de">Berliner Tageblatt</i>, pretended to regard the
wearing of the Belgian or American colours as a
piece of childish mischief, he was simply trying to
put them off the scent, for he of all people had no
illusions as to the significance of the ribbons which
the Belgians are wearing in their buttonholes.
This significance was as follows: The Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
pretend (1) that their armies are victorious and will
remain so; (2) that they will be able to dictate
their terms, and will annex Belgium; (3) that this
will be easy, as the Belgians are already abandoning
their provocative attitude, and are beginning to
fraternize with their persecutors. For the moment
we cannot reply publicly to lies 1 and 2; as to 3,
any Belgian who wears a little rosette tacitly proclaims
that he does not wish to be taken for a
craven, and that his anti-German feelings have lost
none of their keenness.</p>

<p>Other Germans try to deceive their compatriots as
to the feeling of the Belgians for their oppressors.
Here is what Herr Walter Nissen says, the Bruxelles
correspondent of the <i xml:lang="de">Düss. Gen.-Anz.</i> (23rd July,
1915):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Opinion in Belgium is daily becoming more conciliatory.
Belgium may, for the moment, be compared with a woman who
is beginning to love despite herself, and who, through pride and
vexation, says 'No!' as loudly as possible, for fear anyone
should see what is happening to her. But one does see it,
despite the ribbons of the national colours&mdash;indeed precisely on
that account."</p></blockquote>

<p>Is this incurable blindness? Is it an ineradicable
spirit of falsehood? Does Herr Nissen really doubt
the sincerity of our anti-German manifestations?
During the months he has lived in our midst he
must have discovered that we do, systematically,
everything we can to displease the Germans, until
they issue decrees of prohibition.</p>

<p>Here is a last trait which can leave no one in doubt
as to the feelings of the Belgians. In March 1915 the
German authorities organized a concert in the
Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels. There were only
three known Belgians present, among them a professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
of the University of Brussels. The University
showed its disapproval by sending him to Coventry.</p>


<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Behaviour of the German Administration.</i></p>

<p>The preceding pages have already informed the
reader that the Germans have not accustomed us to
look for either gentleness or sincerity. But hitherto
we have not insisted on their administrative procedure,
which nevertheless deserves examination.</p>

<p>But first let us picture to ourselves the mental
condition of the Belgians since August 1914. Cut
off from all intellectual relations with foreign
countries, we receive independent newspapers only
in secret, at the peril of our liberty, or even of
our lives. Every day, on the other hand, the
newspapers, mutilated by the censorship, printing
only the news&mdash;often false&mdash;which is favourable to
the Germans, are instilling their slow poison into
our brains. No matter: the people still repulse all
attempts to foment disunion and demoralization;
they pull their belts a little tighter rather than go
to work for the enemy; they continue, to the last, to
display our colours; in short, they have retained,
unshaken and unshakable, their faith in our just
cause and the final victory.</p>

<p>The German newspapers are full of admiring
articles describing the firmness of mind evinced by
the German people, for they, too, consent to certain
privations to ensure the success of their arms.
Wonderful! The German people are unfailingly
encouraged by their newspapers, their pastors and
priests, their schoolmasters and professors, and by
lectures and innumerable pamphlets. Everything
that might cause their resolution to falter is carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
concealed from them. They are, moreover,
accustomed to hold no other opinions than those
which are officially presented to them. To falter,
under these circumstances, would be almost incomprehensible.
But in our country, on the other hand,
everything is done to exhaust us, to dishearten us.
The least success of the German arms becomes the
"final crushing" of the enemy; the executions of
Belgians who have aided their country are immediately
advertised on every hand; and, finally, we
are prevented, by every imaginable means, from
spreading good news or preaching confidence. That
in spite of all the Belgian should retain his tranquillity
of mind and even his good humour is almost
unbelievable, but it is true.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a population which is systematically
refused the least item of comforting information, but
which, on the other hand, is treated prodigally to
everything of a nature to demoralize it; a population
which, in order not to sink into despair, has to make
an effort every moment of the day; a country in
which it is strictly forbidden to do anything to
encourage those who may suffer from a temporary
depression, or to sustain and reassure those who
feel themselves threatened. Is it not obvious that
such pitiful psychologists as the Germans will resort
to intimidation to reduce this population to their
mercy? Everything is magnified into an offence,
and all offences are punished by the heaviest penalties;
the Germans even going so far as to threaten
with death him who spreads "false news"&mdash;that is
to say, who communicates news to his fellow-citizens
which is displeasing to the Germans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>


<p><i>The Appeal to Informers.</i></p>

<p>The placards already cited show amply the diversity
of the offences which may be committed, and
the punishments which may be inflicted. But we
must not forget those notices which order the
inhabitants, often on pain of death, to inform
against those persons who possess arms; to denounce
those who are <i>believed</i> to be strangers to
the commune; and those <i>suspected</i> of acting in a
manner contrary to the orders of the German
authorities.</p>

<p>Here are some of these notices:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Detention of Arms.</span></div>

<p>The communal administration forwards the following document:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><i>Important Warning.</i></div>

<p>It has come to my knowledge that the inhabitants of the
country are still hiding arms and munitions in their houses.</p>

<p>Those who still have arms in their possession (whether firearms,
bows, cross-bows, arquebuses, or knives and swords of
any description) will not be punished in any way if the arms and
munitions are deposited by the 15th December (noon precisely
German time) at the house of the burgomaster of the commune,
to be handed over to the military commandant.</p>

<p>After the date indicated all persons found in possession of arms
or munitions will be shot. An account also will be demanded of
the burgomasters concerned, and also of all the inhabitants of
the houses or farms in which arms or munitions are found, as
well as the neighbours of the guilty persons.</p>

<p>The death penalty will be imposed on all who learn of the
existence of arms or munitions without warning the burgomaster
of their commune, who must warn the military commandant.</p>

<p>The present decree forms the last appeal to the population to
surrender their arms, and once the 15th December is past the
severest action will be taken.</p>

<p>The burgomasters are personally responsible for ensuring that
this warning receives the widest publication.</p>

<p>They are required to deposit with the nearest military authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
not later than the 15th December (at six o'clock in the evening,
German time) the arms and munitions that shall be delivered
to them.</p>

<p>Those who are <i>believed</i> to be strangers; those who
are <i>suspected</i> of acting contrary to orders ... it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
is a régime of organized suspicion, a reign of
terror, informing erected into a governmental
process.</p>

<p>The most abominable thing which the Germans
have conceived in this respect is that they encourage
the denunciation of militia-men by their fathers,
mothers, wives, or sisters. It is a principle admitted
by all civilized nations&mdash;and also, no doubt, by
Germany&mdash;that the Courts definitely abstain from
evoking a conflict between the paternal and maternal
instinct and the duty owed to justice. It is considered
that it would be revoltingly inhuman to force
a father or mother to bear witness against a son.
Sophocles, in the <i>Antigone</i>, ranks this prejudice
among "the immutable laws, unwritten, which are
from all eternity." Now, in Belgium, when a young
man leaves his family to rejoin the Belgian army,
the German authorities enjoin upon his parents, his
brother, or his sister, the duty of denouncing the
absent man; in other words, his father or his mother&mdash;yes,
we said his mother&mdash;must deliver up the son
because he is doing his duty toward his country
(notice of the 9th April, 1915). And the Germans
are not content with threats. If the Germans forget
their promises, at least they scrupulously carry their
threats into execution. At Hasselt they imprisoned
a woman whose son had rejoined the Belgian army
(p. <a href="#Page_152">152</a>). At Namur they have on many occasions
punished the parents of soldiers who had not committed
the crime of denouncing them. And not
content with inflicting these disgraceful penalties&mdash;disgraceful
to those who impose them&mdash;they have
forced <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> to give publicity to these
sentences, to the number of ten or more. Here are
the details of one sentence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>According to § 3, No. 2, of the Imperial decree of the 28th December,
1893, concerning the extraordinary proceedings of the Council
of War for foreigners, the Governor of the fortified position and the
province of Namur has pronounced a deprivation of liberty against
the following Belgian subjects: the farmer, Félix Duquet, of
Jemeppe, two months; his wife, Victoire Duquet, <i xml:lang="fr">née</i> Swain, one
month. They had harboured their son, Clement Duquet, Belgian
soldier, who had lost his regiment, for several months, instead of
notifying him to the German authority; by so doing they acted
in contravention of the proclamation of the Government of Namur,
dated 19th September, 1914.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, 8-9th July, 1915.)<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Assuredly for the Germans the word "humanity"
is void of meaning; they have replaced it by
"Germanity." No doubt they regard maternal love
among the Belgians as being of an essence so
inferior that they need not take it into account. Yet
in order not to wound the sensibilities of their own
soldiers, nor those of their "brothers by race," the
Flemings, they omitted any mention of mothers in
the German and Flemish texts of their notice of the
4th April. As we have already stated, they feel that
they need not observe towards the feelings of the
Belgians&mdash;and above all of the Walloons&mdash;the same
consideration as is shown towards those of the
Germans.</p>


<p><i>German Espionage.</i></p>

<p>Informing cannot exist without espionage. Now
we know that the Germans are past masters in this
art. Every one of our towns has been favoured by a
swarm of spies, male and female. In the streets, on
the promenades, in the cafés, in the trams<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>&mdash;everywhere
one is conscious of the invisible inspection of
secret agents. Woe to him who utters aloud an
opinion unfavourable to Germany, or complains of a
too outrageous placard or announcement, or criticizes
a passing officer or any one connected with Germany,
or abuses the German army: immediately a lady or
gentleman hails a German soldier, and the offender is
taken to the <i xml:lang="de">Kommandantur</i>. And when a Belgian
enters the <i xml:lang="de">Kommandantur</i> he does not know when
he will come out again; there he awaits, sometimes
for several days, his turn to be interrogated; and
after that imprisonment is certain. Not, of course,
that he is always condemned; it sometimes happens
that the offence has not been proved; but even so,
"his hash is settled," for while he has been waiting
his turn his house has been searched, and where is
the house that does not contain some letter from a
son or a brother who is a soldier? Prohibited
correspondence! Sentenced!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Agents-provocateurs or "Traps."</i></p>

<p>A close espionage surrounds those who undertake
the carrying of letters or the introduction of newspapers.
In this case the spies work principally by
means of "traps"&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr">agents-provocateurs</i>. A spy
introduces himself to the person suspected of dealing
with correspondence; he pretends he has a letter to
send or receive. If the suspect listens to him, a
picket of soldiers and policemen arrives on the following
day to make a search. Other spies will speak in
the street to a seller of newspapers; they will ask for
a French or English journal, and scarcely has the
vendor taken the forbidden journal from his pocket
than a hand falls upon his collar.</p>

<p>It is also by means of "traps" that the Germans
catch those who enable our militia to escape from
the country. A young man, of the proper age, goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
in search of the suspected person, and by means of
false papers passes himself off for a patriot who
wants to take his place at the front. Arrangements
being made, the spy departs; but a skilfully set trap
enables him to catch a whole group of young fellows.
It matters little to our cause, however, since for every
one arrested hundreds cross into Holland every week.
Many Belgians devote themselves to this patriotic
task, though they well know that in case of failure
they will be sent into Germany or shot. It should
be said that their most active helpers are the soldiers
of the Landsturm, the guardians of the frontiers,
who, according to an established tariff, for the sake
of alcohol or money, close their eyes as our militia-men
cross the frontier.</p>

<p>One step further along the path of the informer,
the spy, and the "trap," and we come to means
whose ignominy is such that even the Germans
themselves are forced to admit their dishonesty.</p>

<p>Thus, at Liége most of the letter-boxes on the
house-doors are closed by means of nails. Why?
At the end of 1914 many citizens of Liége used to
receive <i xml:lang="fr">Le Courrier de la Meuse</i>, a newspaper edited
and printed at Maestricht by Belgian refugees.
There was no great mystery about its distribution;
the paper was simply slipped into the letter-box.
But the German agents spied on the vendors, and
having done so, searched the houses at which the
newspaper was delivered. The subscriber, of course,
was condemned to pay a fine. Did part of this go to
the spy? It is probable; in any case it was not long
before the spies were importing <i xml:lang="fr">Le Courrier de la
Meuse</i> in order themselves to place it in the letter-boxes
of well-to-do houses. A search conducted
immediately revealed the prohibited article, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
in spite of the indignant denials of the victim, the
fine was inflicted.</p>

<p>At Ferrières, near Jemelle, worse than this was
done. A German priest pretended that the curé of
Ferrières had repeated, before a witness, a private
conversation held some hours earlier. Moreover, he
wanted to garble the conversation. The abbé's action
was repugnant in such a degree that even Baron von
Bissing himself was a little uneasy about the matter,
and revoked the punishment awarded to the Belgian.</p>

<p>While the mission of the spies and <i xml:lang="fr">agents-provocateurs</i>&mdash;including
the <i xml:lang="fr">abbés-provocateurs</i> or ecclesiastical
"traps"&mdash;was to procure the condemnation
to various penalties of as many Belgians as possible,
other "agents" in the pay of Germany commenced
a vast inquiry, in order to prove, in the face of the
evidence itself, the crimes of the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>."
Well!&mdash;in spite of all the man&oelig;uvres of spies and
<i xml:lang="fr">provocateurs</i> and the inquirers themselves, in spite
of the personal rancour which impelled a few rare
Belgians to become the accomplices of the Germans,
and to denounce, in a spirit of vengeance, certain of
their fellow-citizens, never did the Germans succeed
in mentioning a single name, not one single name,
of a Belgian civilian accused of having fired upon the
German troops. We say expressly "accused," and
not "convicted," to show that nowhere, in village or
provincial town, although petty rivalry is so acute,
and although informers, even though anonymous,
would have been welcomed with joy by the Germans,
nowhere was any one found to assert that a Belgian
civilian had fired on the German troops. No, it was
so improbable, so manifestly false, that not even the
most miserable of wretches would have dreamed of
formulating such a calumny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>The Germans wanted to make us believe that
anonymous letters were pouring in upon them, but
that they, as upright administrators, refused to
follow up these accusations (Declaration, 4th May,
1915). Obviously a lie. We know them capable of
themselves fabricating these anonymous accusations,
simply to cause the Belgians mental uneasiness, and
to give rise to mutual suspicion. This is yet another
attempt to cause dissension.</p>

<p>For the rest, they have since then admitted that
they have invited denunciation. Worse than this:
denunciation is enough to procure condemnation; it
is not necessary for the offence to be proved.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Notice.</span></div>

<p>Cases are increasingly frequent in which letters are sent to
Belgian soldiers at the front by means of intermediaries.</p>

<p>I remind the public that this is strictly prohibited. Any person

</p></blockquote>

<p>We should never come to an end were we to
mention all the tricks and shifts that enter into
their methods of administration. We will confine
ourselves to relating one or two more.</p>

<p>According to the Hague Convention, the functionaries
of an occupied territory who remain at their
posts must declare that they will undertake nothing,
and will refrain from everything, that may be contrary
to the interests of the occupier. Note two
essential points: it is only the <i>officials</i> who are required
to sign this agreement, and they undertake to
<i>refrain</i> from anything that may be hurtful to the
occupier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>Now in January 1915 the German administration
of Namur wished to force the entire male population
of the canton of Éghezée between the ages of eighteen
and forty to sign the following declaration:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I the undersigned promise, conformably with the Hague
Convention of the 18th October, 1907, to continue scrupulously
and loyally the fulfilment of my functions, to undertake nothing
against the interests of the German Empire, and I promise to
prevent all that might be injurious thereto."</p></blockquote>

<p>In certain communes the inhabitants, meaning
well and imperfectly informed as to their rights and
duties, signed this declaration, which is an improper
one, as it was required of all the inhabitants, and not
only of the officials; moreover, it made the signatories
promise to <i>prevent</i> what was injurious to the Germans,
not merely to <i>refrain</i> from it. Up to a certain point,
therefore, all the inhabitants were obliged to place
themselves at the service of the German authorities.
Some burgomasters refused to allow the document
to be signed as it stood. They added, on their own
authority, the following sentence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With the reservation of being able to respond freely to the
appeal of the Belgian Government if the latter comes to resume
possession of the country at present occupied by the German
armies."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Germans did not accept this addition; they
proposed a new form of words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I the undersigned promise, conformably with the provisions of
the Hague Convention of 18th October, 1907, to continue scrupulously
and faithfully in the performance of my functions, to
undertake nothing against the interests of the German Empire,
to refrain from all that might injure it."</p></blockquote>

<p>In many villages the people again refused to
sign. Men between 18 and 40 years of age cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
promise to continue in the performance of functions
which they have never fulfilled. What did the
Germans do? They forced all the male inhabitants
of the recalcitrant communes to present themselves
daily at Éghezée, the chief town of the canton. But
eventually they realized that it was iniquitous to
make these men lose half their day every day simply
because they, the Germans, were demanding an
absolutely illegal thing. So the daily muster at
Éghezée was abandoned.</p>

<p>The German administration falsely invoked the
Hague Convention of 1907 in addressing the peasants,
who doubtless did not even know the Convention by
name, and it tried twice over to take advantage of
their good faith. It is not surprising that the inhabitants
of the province of Namur should have
become suspicious, so that they would not willingly
put their names to any paper presented by the
Germans. In May it was only after long negotiations
and threats that the young men of Rhisnes and
Emines signed their identification cards, which,
according to the Germans, "imposed no engagement
on the signatory." We have not ourselves seen the
wording of this card, so we cannot speak as to its
tenor; but it is curious that the Germans should be
so insistent upon the signing of a card having so
little significance.</p>

<p>They also wished to impose, on the civic guard of
Rhisnes and Emines, the engagement that they
would no longer bear arms against Germany. More
than half the men refused, and were sent as prisoners
of war to Germany.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Monday, 3rd May, in the morning, sixty-nine Belgian militia-men
of the communes of Rhisnes and Emines were arrested
because they refused to sign their identification cards, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
contained nothing else than the information as to their persons
necessary to complete such a document. They were taken to the
prison of the fortress. On 6th May they were questioned a second
time, and, having all without exception signed, they were immediately
released.</p>

<p>Tuesday, 4th May, 107 members of the civic guard at Rhisnes
were arrested because they refused to sign the declaration that
they would not bear arms against Germany and her Allies during
this war. In the course of the same day forty-nine signed the
declaration and were released. The other fifty-eight maintained
their refusal, and were transported to Germany as prisoners of
war on Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the 5th May, eighty members of the civic guard of
Emines and Warisoulx were arrested for the same reason; forty
signed the declaration and were released. The rest were transported
to Germany on the evening of the 6th May as prisoners
of war.</p>

<p>Similarly on the 5th May, in the afternoon, 170 men, part being
members of the civic guard and part militia-men of the communes
of Taviers, Dhuy, St.-Germain, Hemptinne, Villers-lez-Heest, and
Bovesse, were arrested because they refused to sign their identification
cards. The Government hopes that these men will reflect
and hear reason, and that they will submit spontaneously to this
measure, which serves only for purposes of registration, so that
they may be released.</p>

<p>It is expressly added that the signature of the identification
cards imposes no engagement on the signatory; these cards contain
only information as to identity, and all the Belgian militia-men,
as well as the members of the civic guard, have been several
times informed upon this point.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i>Communicated.</i>)<br />
</div>
<p>
(<i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, 7th and 8th May, 1915.)<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us look into this case.</p>

<p>In the first place, there never was a civic guard
at Rhisnes nor at Emines, so that it is absolutely
fraudulent to give this title to all the male adult
inhabitants; and since they have not been civic
guards they have never borne arms against Germany,
and cannot therefore engage to cease doing
so. Here again appears the German duplicity in all
its beauty. The men of Rhisnes and Emines assure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
us that the paper said "no longer bear arms against
Germany." The Germans have imposed a communiqué
upon <i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i> which gives
another version&mdash;"not to bear arms."</p>

<p>But in the communiqué provided by the German
authorities and published in <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique</i> on the
5th June, our enemies recognize that the document
said "no longer bear arms." However, a German
communiqué is never entirely truthful; and this one
forms no exception to the rule. Conforming to the
truth in this respect, it departs from it in another.
It says, in effect, that the men of Rhisnes "regarded
themselves as still belonging to the Belgian Army."
What absurdity! They refused to sign precisely
because the Germans wished to make them say
that they did belong to the Army!</p>

<p>In August and September 1914 the Germans
were sending Belgians into Germany as civil
prisoners; in May 1915 they were sending them
as prisoners of war. The difference is important,
since the Hague Convention states that the cost
of maintenance of war prisoners falls upon their
country of origin, but that it is not speaking of civil
prisoners. This is why the civilians of Rhisnes and
Emines went to Germany as prisoners of war, as
did the curé and the vicar of Cortemarck (p. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>).</p>

<p>We have already cited (p. <a href="#Page_233">233</a>) one case of premeditated
abuse of a signature. Here is another:
In October 1914 the German authorities of Mont
St.-Guibert (between Ottignies and Trembloux) had
the following placard posted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Notice.</span></div>

<p>1. All the male inhabitants of the commune aged from 18
to 45 years, rich or poor, must present themselves to-morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Tuesday, morning, the 6th October, at 7 o'clock in the morning
(Belgium time) at the railway booking-office.</p>

<p>2. These inhabitants can no longer change their place
of residence; their names have been given to the military
authorities.</p>

<p>Those who do not carry out this order, who seek to escape,
will be made prisoners and will render themselves liable to be
shot. The families of offenders will be taken as prisoners and
their property destroyed.</p>

<p>3. English, French, or Russians who are in the locality must
be delivered to the military authorities. The same with Belgians
having belonged to the Army who are deserters or have been
prisoners. Offenders will be punished by death.</p>

<p>4. Fire-arms of all kinds which are still in possession of the
inhabitants must be deposited immediately with the commandant
of the railway-station. Those who are discovered to be still in
possession of these arms, after the publication of this notice, will
be shot.</p>

<p>5. Assemblies for roll-call will be held from time to time.
The day and hour will be given in advance.</p>

<p>6. Umbrellas and sticks are forbidden at the station. Men
must not present themselves in a state of drunkenness.</p>

<p>

<span class="smcap">Hamich</span>, <i>Sergeant</i>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This placard threatens penalties, even shooting,
for the failure to attend at the railway-station;
moreover, the offender's family is of course held
responsible. So far it is commonplace enough.
We will say nothing as to the grade of officer
who thus disposes of the lives of citizens&mdash;he is
a sergeant; but we know that the humblest German
soldier possesses every right. What does rather
surpass the usual level German administrative procedure
is the fact that the burgomaster, whose
name figures at the bottom of the placard, knew
nothing of the latter until it was posted. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
sergeant had used his name without deigning to
consult him.</p>

<p>To give a complete idea of the administrative
methods employed by the Germans against our
country, it will be as well rapidly to describe how
they behaved in a certain locality immediately after
proceeding against the "<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>." Hitherto
we have dealt only with places where they did not
have to carry out "reprisals." We will now select
Andenne, on account of the particularly savage
character of the "repression" which drenched this
unhappy town with blood and fire. Here are the
facts in their tragic sequence:&mdash;</p>

<p>The German patrol which penetrated into the
town on the 19th August, 1914, went straight to
the house of the communal receiver and seized the
funds: 2,232 frs.</p>

<p>On the following day the bulk of the troops
arrived. That evening, between 6 and 9 p.m., a
very sharp fusillade broke out. Immediately the
civilians were accused of having fired, and the
troops began to shoot down the inhabitants and
burn the houses.</p>

<p>On the following morning&mdash;the 21st August&mdash;all
the inhabitants not yet shot were driven into the
Place des Tilleuls. The men were herded on one
side, the women on the other. From time to time
Major Scheunemann, who commanded the operations,
had a few men shot, sometimes before the
whole population, sometimes a little apart. During
the morning the soldiers dragged the corpse of the
burgomaster, Dr. Camus, into the Place. As soon
as Major Scheunemann learned of the death of the
first magistrate, he appointed as burgomaster M. de
Jaer, who was one of the group of persons waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
their turn to be shot. From that moment the order
was given to kill no more; they contented themselves
with sack and pillage. There were then
300 houses burned at Andenne and at Seilles,
and 300 inhabitants were shot (<i>11th Report</i>).</p>

<p>We will confine ourselves, as regards the events
which followed the burning and the massacre, to
reprinting the placard posted at Andenne during
the first ten days of the occupation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Inhabitants of Andenne.</span></div>

<p>By order of the German military authority occupying the
town of Andenne:&mdash;</p>

<p>All the men are held as hostages.</p>

<p>Per shot fired on the German troops, there will be <i>at least</i> two
hostages shot.</p>

<p>The hostages will be fed by the women, who will carry them
the necessaries close to the bridge at 6 in the evening and 8 in
the morning.</p>

<p>Women are strictly forbidden to converse with the hostages.</p>

<p>All the streets and public places will immediately be cleaned
by all the women of the town, on pain of immediate arrest.</p>

<p>It is strictly forbidden to move about the town after 7 in the
evening and before 7 in the morning, on pain of severe repression.</p>

<p>The dead will immediately be buried without any formality.</p>

<p>Young people over 14 and the women must give their assistance
in every case of requisition.</p>

<p>It is strictly forbidden to show oneself at the windows.</p>

<p>On the 20th August of this year there was firing from
numerous houses of the town of Andenne on the German troops
who were passing through the town; bombs also were thrown.
It is certain that the first outbreak of firing occurred, according
to a certain plan, at precisely the same time in several streets: in
the Rue Brun, the Rue de l'Hôtel de Ville, the Place des Tilleuls,
and several other streets. A number of soldiers have been killed

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Fellow-Citizens,</span></p>

<p>We are happy to announce to you that the military
authority will show the greatest goodwill towards us if, as we
doubt not, the worthy population of Andenne continues to
remain perfectly quiet, to labour with courage, and to obey
authority with docility, <i>as it has done</i> up to the present, for
which we thank it.</p>

<p>At a military fête, at which the military authority expressly
invited us to be present, all the troops, including the officers&mdash;in
our presence, and before many of the notables of Andenne,
and Dean Cartiaux in particular&mdash;repeatedly shouted "Hurrah
for Andenne!"</p>

<p>In the name of all of you, much affected, we expressed our
thanks.</p>

<p>Dear friends, have confidence in us; we are working with
all our souls for the safety of Andenne.</p>

<p>We have assured the military authority that the soldiers
might be perfectly at ease in our midst, that none of us would
wish to commit the least aggression&mdash;that, on the contrary,
we shall all treat the Germany Army with <i>complete loyalty</i>. We
have been responsible for you. In return, we ask you only
one thing: it is, to continue to do what you have done until
to-day, and, if, by some impossible chance, there should be
among us an ill-conditioned person who might be capable of
compromising honest people, point him out to us; for our
worthy fellow-citizens must not be responsible for the crimes
of a scoundrel.</p>

<p>Let the German Army be sure that the communal administration
will with the utmost promptness hand over to it any one
guilty of an act of ill-will, whoever he may be.</p>

<p>Dear fellow-citizens, patience and courage to support privation.
Be easy in your minds; we are with you.</p>

<p>One word as to these placards.</p>

<p><i>Placard of the 21st August.</i>&mdash;The men are all
regarded as hostages; the women have to feed
them; they also have to clean up the town.</p>

<p><i>Placard of the 22nd August.</i>&mdash;The military
authorities declare, on the 22nd of August, that
Andenne, where the "attacks of <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>"
were repressed during the night of the 20th and
the morning of the 21st, is already regarded by the
whole civilized world as "a nest of murderers and
bandits." It offers a reward of 500 to 1000 frs.
to any one who will denounce the author of the
plot. It also promises, to excite the zeal of the
informers, that the severe measures in force will
be mitigated as soon as the leaders are discovered.
(No one was denounced.)</p>

<p><i>1st Placard of the 23rd August.</i>&mdash;This announces
the great victory between Sarrebourg and Metz:
21,000 French prisoners were taken. (An attempt
to demoralize the population.) Note that the Wolff
Agency reported only 10,000 prisoners; where did
Major Scheunemann find the other 11,000?</p>

<p><i>2nd Placard of the 23rd August.</i>&mdash;The Germans
are attending to the revictualling of Andenne. (In
reality the people of Andenne were starving.)</p>

<p><i>Placard of the 25th August.</i>&mdash;The German administration
is strict, but just. (The people of
Andenne had noticed the severity.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p><i>1st Placard of the 28th August.</i>&mdash;Once again the
inhabitants are urged to remain calm, and are
congratulated on their good conduct. (The burgomaster
was forced to countersign this proclamation.
Had he seen it first?)</p>

<p><i>2nd Placard of the 28th August.</i>&mdash;The German
time is made compulsory. Assemblies of more than
three persons are prohibited. If arms are found
in a house their owner will be hanged. At the
least disturbance, the complete burning of the town
and the hanging of the men.</p>

<p><i>1st Placard of the 30th August.</i>&mdash;The German
troops, having pillaged Andenne and shot down
its inhabitants, now shout "Hurrah for Andenne!"
Then a fresh appeal to informers.</p>

<p><i>2nd Placard of the 30th August.</i>&mdash;The German
authorities now promise to make an inquiry if there
is another revolt. (This inquiry would have been
a novelty.)</p>


<h3>E.&mdash;Ferocity.</h3>

<p>We may be brief, for the cruel character of <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>
is so obvious, and appears so plainly from the
documents cited, that it would be idle to insist
upon it.</p>

<p>If it were necessary to justify our aversion, we need
only remark that the cruelties recorded were systematically
premeditated. Do not the <i xml:lang="de">Kriegsbrauch
im Landkriege</i> (<i>Usages of War on Land according to
the Great General Staff</i>) state that the observation
of these usages is not "guaranteed by any sanction
other than the fear of reprisals," and that the
officer, the child of his age, carried away by the
moral tendencies which affect his country, must
protect himself "against exaggerated humanitarian
ideas," and must realize that "the only true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
humanity often resides in the unmitigated employment
of these severities?" If such principles
are professed by the highest authorities, the German
soldier will not shrink from any degree of violence;
for he knows that wickedness will not merely
provide him with amusement; it will also help to
achieve the final aim of warfare.</p>

<p>So that the officer shall be in no danger of
forgetting the spirit in which he should conceive
his relations with the enemy population, he carries
some such aid to memory as the <i xml:lang="de">Tornister-Wörterbuch</i>.
If he has letters or proclamations
to draft, he has recourse to <i xml:lang="fr">L'Interprète Militaire</i>
of Captain von Scharfenort, professor and
librarian at the Academy of War in Berlin. M.
Waxweiler (in <i xml:lang="fr">La Belgique Neutre et Loyale</i>, p. 265)
has already drawn attention to the cruel and odious
character of this <i xml:lang="la">vade-mecum</i>, so we will not enlarge
upon it. It was after consulting <i xml:lang="fr">L'Interprète
Militaire</i> that a certain placard posted in Belgium
in the August of 1914 was drafted. It gives no
details as to the "lugubrious cruelties"; it applies
both to towns and villages; it speaks of the
"mayor" instead of the "burgomaster"; it is
neither dated nor signed; in short, it presents all
the characteristics of an "emergency placard,"
drafted beforehand.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Proclamation.</span></div>

<p>We are not making war upon citizens, but only on the enemy
army.</p>

<p>In spite of this, the German troops have been attacked in great
number by persons who do not belong to the army. They have
committed <i>acts of the most lugubrious cruelty</i> not only against
combatants, but also against our wounded and our doctors who
are under the protection of the Red Cross. To prevent these
brutalities I order that which follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>1.  Any person who does not belong to the army and who
is found arms in hand, will be shot instantly. He will be
regarded as outside the laws of nations.</p>

<p>2.  All arms, rifles, pistols, Brownings, sabres, daggers, etc., and
all explosive material, must be delivered immediately by the
mayors of every village or town to the commander of the German
troops; if a single weapon is found, no matter in what house, or
if any act has been committed against our troops, our transports,
our telegraph lines, our railways, etc., or if any one gives asylum
to <i xml:lang="fr"><span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span></i>; the guilty persons and the hostages who will be
taken in each village will be shot without pity. Besides this, the
inhabitants of the villages, etc., in question will be driven out.
The villages and towns even will be demolished and burned. If
this happens on the road of communication between two villages
or two towns, the inhabitants of the two villages will be treated in
the same manner.</p>

<p>I expect the mayors and populations will be able, by their
prudent supervision and conduct, to ensure the safety of our
troops as well as their own.</p>

<p>In the contrary case, the measures indicated above will come
into force.</p>

<div class="right">
Signed: <span class="smcap">The General Commanding-in-Chief</span>.<br />
(No name.)<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The appeal to brutality comes from above. In
1900 the whole world shuddered at the advice which
Wilhelm II gave the expeditionary corps setting out
for China. "Follow the example of the Huns,"
cried the Kaiser. Why, then, do the Germans
profess to be annoyed when compared to-day with
the soldiers of Attila&mdash;or when their motto is spelt
<i xml:lang="de">Gott mit Huns</i>?</p>

<p>A German lieutenant, whose military note-book
we have had before us, does full justice to his companions.
After the massacre and burning of
Ottignies on the 20th August, 1914, he wrote as
follows (we translate):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The inhabitants were in the square, under a guard of soldiers.
Several men were condemned by the Council of War and at once
put to death. The women, dressed in black, as in a solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
procession, then departed. Among those who had just fallen,
how many innocent were shot! The village has been literally
sacked: the "blond brute" has shown himself for what he is.
The Huns and the freebooters of the Middle Ages could not have
done better. The houses are burning now, and when the action
of the fire is not enough we raze what remains standing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Very suggestive too is the placard of the 26th April,
1915, in which Baron von Bissing informs us that
according to Mr. Fox, an American journalist, the
Germans have committed no useless "cruelties."
Then there are useful cruelties? Really the
Governor-General, who seems to know his subject,
ought to publish a table differentiating the various
qualities of cruelty.</p>

<p>But a thing that does surprise us is that the virus
of cruelty should already have contaminated civilians&mdash;I
mean the Catholic members of the Reichstag.
Herr Erzberger, the same who asserted, and who
perhaps is asserting still, that the Belgians invaded
Germany on the 2nd August, wrote what are
perhaps the most coldly ferocious words imaginable:
"<i>Above all, no sentimentality!</i>" (<i>N.R.C.</i>, 6th
February, 1916, evening edition).</p>

<p>Such advice bore fruit, as we shall discover when
we come to examine, in succession, the physical and
moral tortures in which our executioners delight.
But first let us cite a few examples of <i>aggravations</i>.
By that we mean acts of malice which do not
endanger the life or reason of the victims, but which
reveal, perhaps the more clearly for that, the desire
to torment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">1. Aggravations.</span></h3>

<p>A general remark occurs to us at once: it is that
the Germans have failed in their object. For instead
of exasperating us to the point of forcing us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
commit some imprudence, which they would have
been obliged to repress, they simply made sure of
our profound contempt. To tell the truth, each
fresh persecution makes us furious for a day; but
the sense of irony soon regains the upper hand,
and then we have only one anxiety: to make their
latest form of vexation ridiculous by all the means
in our power.</p>

<p>Nothing better shows the contrast between the
German mentality and the Belgian than the manner
in which we have obeyed the decree concerning
the German time.</p>

<p>After only a week's occupation the inhabitants
of Andenne were obliged to set their clocks to the
German time. At Namur, too, this was required
from the 31st August. Elsewhere the German
time was enforced only at a much later date,
and only in respect of the clocks in cafés. Many
cabaret-keepers merely stopped their clocks; others
had fitted a second small hand, an hour in retard
of the first; others wrote beneath the clock "German
Time," or even "This clock is an hour fast." In
the window of a Brussels watchmaker, in the midst
of many clocks which indicated more or less precisely
the German time, was one which was specially
labelled "Correct Time"&mdash;and that one told, of
course, the Belgian time. In short, every one did
what he could to avoid letting his customers regard
the German time as the true time. And really, if
one has adopted, as is the case in Germany and
in Belgium, the system of hourly segments, it is
obvious that Belgium ought to form part of the
segment of Western Europe, not part of that of
Eastern Europe. It is, therefore, solely in a spirit
of aggravation that Germany forces her time upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
us; and she is fully aware of this, as her public
notices are always careful to speak of "German
time," not of "Central European time."</p>


<p><i>Treatment inflicted upon Belgian Ladies.</i></p>

<p>What do you think of the additional suffering
inflicted on ladies condemned to several weeks'
imprisonment for having conveyed letters from
Belgian soldiers to the parents of those soldiers,
or for speaking a little too boldly before an officer,
or for some other crime of a like nature? It is
a delicate idea to shut them up in common with
half a score of other prisoners, in a room containing
no convenience but a pail furnished with a cover.
They are lucky if the company does not include
some very dubious characters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We need not insist: these are aggravations, not
serious at bottom, but their irritating nature can
only be fully appreciated when one suffers them
daily, or hears them described by friends or relatives
who have been their victims.</p>

<p>After the examples of collective and impersonal
malfeasance dictated by some high officer desirous
of justifying the fair fame of <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>, we will take
those cases in which the personality of the author
clearly reveals itself, and, let us say at once, in
which this personality instantly excites the disgust
and indignation of all merely civilized persons.</p>

<p>The Germans reached Capelle-au-Bois on the
30th August. But on the 31st they were repulsed
by Belgian troops. On the 4th September they
returned in force and forced back the Belgians;
not without difficulty, however, for they had many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
killed, of whom nineteen were buried at Capelle-au-Bois.
With the Belgian troops as they withdrew
went all the inhabitants of the village, leaving
behind them only a few helpless old people. In
this all but empty village, where no one was left
to offer them the least resistance, the Germans
hastened to kill several inhabitants&mdash;four, it is
believed. Then, under the orders of Captain von
Puttkammer, the strong-boxes were broken open,
the objects of value packed and sent to Germany,
and the wines carried to the bank of the canal and
into the houses occupied by the officers. On the
evening of the 4th September the troops set fire
to the village. Thanks to incendiary pastilles and
benzine pumps, the fire spread rapidly; 235 houses
were burned of the three hundred which formed the
heart of the village. So far all was as usual; but
here is the characteristic fact. The better to enjoy
the spectacle the troops spent the evening on the
bank of the canal; there they organized a little orgie,
over eight hundred empty bottles being afterwards
discovered.</p>

<p>At the same period the Germans established a
few miles further to the west, at Londerzeel,
pillaged and then burned the house of the notary,
M. Van Hover. They had tried in vain to open
the safe, so, furious at their failure, they poured
benzine into it and set fire to it, procuring at least
the satisfaction of knowing that all the papers
would be reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>What are we to think of the officer who, lodging
in the house of a curé in the province of Antwerp,
found it amusing to tear pages from the books
which formed his host's library, or to gum them
together, so that in seeking to separate them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
owner himself would tear them? Note that it
was no clown who devised this kindly pastime,
for he took care to choose, in the Latin books,
the pages bearing the most important passages.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>


<p><i>Filthy Amusements.</i></p>

<p>Others preferred to defile things. When in
August and September 1914 we were told that the
Germans were amusing themselves by depositing
ordure in their beds we refused to believe in such
perversion. But a walk through Eppeghem, Sempst,
and Weerde was enough to enlighten us. Not only
had they emptied all the houses, rich or poor; not
only had they taken the trouble to smash into
quite small pieces all the glass and crockery they
could not carry away; not only, in the grocers' shops,
had they delighted themselves by mixing snuff
with the butter, and tacks with the cloves, and
pepper with the flour, but all the bedding bore
the malodorous traces of their visit.</p>

<p>Let it not be imagined that this mania of
beastliness is peculiar to the common soldiers.
The officers who spent the night of the 19th
August, 1915, at Cortenburg, between Louvain
and Brussels, were infected by the same <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i>.
In a certain house they carefully laid the table in
the dining-room, without forgetting the serviettes,
and then deposited a souvenir on every plate. In
another house in Cortenburg they chose, as a
receptacle, the tall hat of the householder. In
the château of Malderen (Brabant), having taken
all that pleased them and broken the rest into
small pieces, they opened a card-table, deposited
their excrement there, and carefully closed it again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>
<p>Another manifestation of the scatological mania:
Many hundreds of German Army surgeons met in
congress during the Easter holidays of 1915, in
Brussels. On the last day of the congress, Wednesday,
the 7th April, a banquet was held, on the
premises of the Palais de Justice. On the Thursday
morning it was discovered that the surgeons
had left souvenirs behind them; they had evacuated
the surplus of food and liquor consumed by the
three natural orifices, and had chosen for their
purpose the most beautiful halls of the Palais.
Frankly, we should not have expected this from
the doctors; it is true, however, that they were
German military doctors.</p>

<p>A man amuses himself as he can&mdash;or, to put it
more plainly, according to his mentality. After
all, these beastly habits, disgusting as they are,
are not those whose results are most disagreeable.</p>

<p>There are others who seek violent contrasts.
Thus, at Houtem, while the church was burning,
on the 13th September, 1914, a military band was
playing its liveliest selections at a few yards'
distance. At Monceau-sur-Sambre, on the 22nd
August, officers were playing the piano in the
château of the demoiselles Bourriez, on the
Trazegnies road, when the soldiers had already
lit the upper floors. At Louvain, on the 25th
August, 1914, in a café near the railway-station,
soldiers set fire to the upper floor without warning
the proprietor, and remained below, where they
kept a mechanical piano going. They were thus
able to enjoy the despairing expressions of the
inmates when they discovered that they could no
longer hope to save anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">2. Physical Tortures.</span></h3>

<p>We shall not here refer to the innumerable cases
of torture cited in the Reports of the Commission
of Inquiry, nor those reported in Nothomb's <i xml:lang="fr">La
Belgique Martyre</i>. We will confine ourselves to
facts of which we have personal knowledge. The
Germans will, of course, seek to deny them. So
it is as well to begin by a declaration of their
own. <i xml:lang="de">Vorwärts</i>, on the 23rd August, 1914 (the
very day on which the chief atrocities were committed
in the Dinant district), protested against
the proposal made by a German officer, not to kill
<span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span> outright, but to wound them mortally
and leave them to die slowly in agony, while forbidding
any one to go to their assistance. What
to our mind is even graver than the proposition
itself is the fact that the <i xml:lang="de">Deutsches Offizierblatt</i>
accepted it as quite a natural thing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is clear that where they are proved, the cruelties committed
by our enemies must be denounced, and that everything
must be done to prevent their repetition. However, we must
not allow the recital of these cruelties to force us to resort to a
sort of policy of retaliation, or lead us to wash out what others
have done with innocent blood.</p>

<p>What are we to say when we find an organ like the <i xml:lang="de">Deutsches
Offizierblatt</i> expressing its sympathy for the following proposition:
The "brutes" captured as <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span> should not be
shot outright, but should be fired upon and left to their fate, all
succour being prevented? What again are we to say when it
is added that the destruction, in reprisal, of whole localities even
does not represent "a sufficient vengeance for the bones of a
single Pomeranian grenadier assassinated"? These are the
imaginings of bloodthirsty fanatics, and we are ashamed to
perceive that men capable of speaking thus exist in our nation.
Such expressions, even if they are not carried into action, are
truly of a nature to place our struggle in an unfavourable light
all the world over.</p>

<p><i>The Fate of the Valkenaers Family.</i></p>

<p>One of the most horrible tragedies of this war
was the massacre of the Valkenaers family, at
Thildonck, on the 26th August, 1914, while Louvain
was burning. Because they had not prevented the
Belgian soldiers from utilizing their farms as points
of support, the members of the two Valkenaers
households were shot down in cold blood. Of these
fourteen unfortunate people three were grievously
wounded and seven killed. The better to amuse
themselves, the Germans forced the elder of the
young girls to wave a sort of flag.</p>

<p>During the preceding night (that of the 25th
August), in Louvain, they had savagely mangled
the corpse of a young woman.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 25th, being still in the
immediate neighbourhood, at Bueken, they had
seized the curé and cut off his nose and ears before
giving him the <i xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</i> (p. <a href="#Page_238">238</a>). At the
same time began the torture of the curé of Pont-Brûlé,
to end only on the 26th.</p>

<p>At Elewijt, on the 27th, they amused themselves
by amputating the hands of four men&mdash;the three
brothers Van der Aa and François Salu.</p>

<p>A little further to the east the first German
troops who had passed through Schaffen, near Diest,
on the 13th or 14th August, had there tortured the
blacksmith Broeden. All day long he had laboured,
shoeing the horses of the enemy's cavalry. Early
in the evening he repaired to the church, with the
sacristan, with the object of saving some precious
articles which had not been placed in security.
He was surprised by the soldiery and seized.
Successively the Germans broke his wrists, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
arms, and his legs; perhaps he suffered yet other
tortures. When he was practically lifeless the
soldiers asked him whether he thought that he
would in future be capable of undertaking any
kind of labour. On his replying, in an almost
inaudible voice, that he did not, they declared that
in that case he ought not to continue to live.
Immediately they threw him, head first, into a
ditch dug for the purpose; then the ditch was
filled, leaving his feet protruding.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In other parts of the country also the most varied
tortures. At Spontin, near Dinant, on the 23rd
August, 1914, they pierced the curé and the burgomaster
with bayonet-wounds until death ensued;
but first they had bound each man with a strong
cord, drawn violently tight round the waist by the
combined efforts of two soldiers. It must be supposed
that the officer who presided over the "severities"
at Spontin had quite a special affection for
cords, for having taken alive some 120 inhabitants
of the place (the rest were killed, shot down while
they were trying to escape), he had them all tied
together by the wrists and conveyed them towards
Dorinn; but many were shot before reaching that
village.</p>

<p>On the same day, in Dinant prison, a soldier
strangled a baby in the arms of its mother because
it was crying too loud.</p>

<p>At Sorinnes, still in the Dinant district, and on
the same day, Jules and Albert Houzieaux were
burned alive.</p>

<p>At Aiseau, on the 21st August, the Germans shut
two men into a house, to which they set fire. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
the unexpected arrival of a shell prevented them
from enjoying the sufferings of their victims.</p>

<p>At Hofstade chance favoured them better; they
threw Victor de Coster, whom they had just stripped,
into the furnace provided by his own house; his
servant shared his fate.</p>

<p>We must suppose that the Germans take great
pleasure in the contortions of the hanged. Herr
Heymel had to content himself with admiring the
corpse of a priest swinging in a tree; and his friend,
Herr Klemm, was careful to devote, to the memory
of this comforting spectacle, a drawing, published in
<i xml:lang="de">Kunst und Künstler</i> (January 1915). Herr Heymel
expresses his great satisfaction before this spectacle;
but what pleasure he would have experienced could
he have witnessed the hanging of the men whom
the Germans boast of having hanged to the trees of
the Herve district; or could he have assisted to
hang that inhabitant of Èvelette, whom the soldiers
put to death at Andenne, on the 20th; or the
cabaret-keeper who was strung up to a lantern
before the Louvain railway-station, on the night
of the 26th; but our fastidious <i>littérateur</i> would
have tasted the keenest delight at Arlon, when an
old man was put to death; he remained hanging
for hours, with his feet just grazing the soil
(p. <a href="#Page_351">351</a>).</p>

<p>The Germans, perhaps, will say&mdash;supposing they
think they ought to excuse themselves&mdash;that these
executions were carried out as a result of the
attacks of <span xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</span>, or after the mutilation of
the German wounded by Belgian civilians. But
it will be impossible for them to allege these lies as
circumstances extenuating the inhuman treatment
which they inflicted upon Belgian soldiers at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
time of their first attacks on the forts of Liége, on
the night of the 4th August; that is, a few hours
after the commencement of hostilities. Not only
did they maltreat in every imaginable manner
their Belgian prisoners, but certain German soldiers
pushed <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i> so far as to refuse water to poor
wounded fellows dying of thirst; more, they even
gave themselves the atrocious pleasure of spilling
on the ground the water contained in the wounded
men's own flasks, and this before their eyes.</p>


<div class="right"><span class="smcap">3. Moral Tortures.</span></div>

<p>The physical tortures which the Germans have
inflicted upon us cannot rival their methods of
moral torture. In these they have achieved refinements
worthy of the inventive genius of an Edgar
Allan Poë.</p>


<p><i>Moral Torture before Execution.</i></p>

<p>To force those about to be shot to dig their own
graves, as they did at Tavigny,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> is quite a commonplace
method. In the Fonds de Leffe, on the 23rd
August, 1914 (p. <a href="#Page_360">360</a>), they perfected their mode of
operation. They had called up eight men of Dinant
to bury the victims as they were shot (there was so
much work to do that it had to be entrusted to
experienced hands). In the evening each of the
gravediggers dug his own grave; four were shot,
and buried by their colleagues; just as these were
about to suffer the same fate an officer "pardoned"
them: not out of humanity (that would have been
too decent), but simply because their services would
be required during the following days.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>
<p>At Dinant, during the bloody days of the 23rd
and 24th August, they invented many other moral
tortures. On the morning of the 23rd they shot,
in a meadow of the Fonds de Leffe, a group of
thirteen men. But instead of leading them all
together before the firing platoon, they cunningly
prolonged their pleasure; the thirteen unfortunates
were tied, in succession, to the same tree, and shot
down one by one.</p>

<p>The whole of the 23rd was consecrated, in the
Fonds de Leffe, to killing the men in small batches
of half a dozen; these were shot either before their
wives and children, or at a short distance, but within
earshot, so that the family should lose none of the
groans of the dying.</p>

<p>When, later on, the women and children were shut
up in a windmill, having first been marched in front
of the corpses, the Germans allowed themselves the
distraction of lighting fires before the windows from
time to time, in order to make the women believe
that they were about to be burned alive with their
children, and to delight in their anguish.</p>

<p>While men were being shot in the Fonds de Leffe,
horrible massacres were being committed at Leffe
and at Dinant, at only a few minutes' distance.
Here, too, men were shot before their families&mdash;for
example, Victor Poncelet and Charles Naus&mdash;and
the survivors were forced to pass through the midst
of the corpses. The officers, too, devised more
complicated diversions; for instance, allowing a
group of women and children to escape into the
mountains, in order to shoot them down from a
distance.</p>

<p>A moral torture commonly employed is that which
consists in making people believe that they are going
to be killed. All the inhabitants of Sorinnes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
placed before machine-guns, and a German chaplain,
speaking French, ceremoniously shook each man by
the hand. At Dinant two or three hundred persons
were lined up against a wall; then a pastor recited
the prayers for the dead (perhaps the chaplain of
Sorinnes had found another opportunity for his pleasantry),
and an empty machine-gun was pointed at
them. An officer laughed as though his sides would
split while he threatened, with his revolver, some
fifteen women shut up in the convent of Prémontré,
at Leffe.</p>

<p>Pretended executions and threats of execution
were everywhere in common usage. At Wépion,
near Namur, on the 23rd August, 1914 (the day
of the Dinant horrors), the Germans packed the
women into boats, and told them to row into the
middle of the Meuse. They took aim at them
several times; then, having sufficiently amused
themselves, they allowed them to return to the
bank.</p>

<p>On the 28th September, 1914, a group of civil
prisoners from the north of Brabant were going
towards the railway-station, whence they left for
Germany. The procession was preceded by a military
band, which played funeral marches, so that
they were convinced that they were being led to
execution.</p>

<p>Two citizens of Brussels, taking a walk on
Sunday, the 30th August, ventured as far as
Koningsloo, in the suburbs. They were seized by
German sentinels, and imprisoned at the post. From
time to time an under-officer approached them, held
his revolver under their noses, and grimaced at
them: "Ah, ah, walk's over, walk's done!" (<i xml:lang="fr">Fini,
promenade!</i>). One of the prisoners asked the guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
if they were really going to be shot; in which case
they would wish to make certain arrangements.
But the soldier reassured them: "Don't be afraid,"
he said, "it's only a game of our officer's; he does
it every day to amuse himself." And sure enough,
towards evening the two prisoners were set free
without further ceremony.</p>

<p>Sectional execution&mdash;execution by small groups&mdash;under
the eyes of those awaiting their fate,
was applied on a large scale at Arlon. On the
26th August, 123 (or 118, or 127) inhabitants of
Rossignol and neighbouring localities were taken
thither, and were killed in groups of ten or twelve.
Madame Hurieaux was reserved for the last; she saw
her husband and all her companions in misfortune
perish first; and she died crying "Vive la Belgique!
Vive la France!"</p>

<p>It will be of interest to reproduce here the
narrative of a medical student who was present at
the executions which took place at Arlon. It may
be taken as a sample, so to speak, of the German
procedure: massacre and incendiarism, with no
previous inquiry; the most varied moral and
physical tortures; capricious condemnation or
liberation of prisoners; pillage of the communal
funds, etc.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the beginning of August I left Y&mdash;&mdash;, where my parents
live, to go to the village of X&mdash;&mdash;, lying to the north of my
native town.</p>

<p>Two days later the French arrived, making towards the north
of Luxemburg. There were movements of troops in different
directions, and soon one could see that battles would be fought in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I thought I could make myself useful by opening a small
ambulance, which I did.</p>

<p>I was lodging with one of my aunts, who has a son of my
own age.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>
<p>One day an engagement took place between the French and
the German troops, and a wounded German soldier was brought
into my little ambulance; his name was Kohn.</p>

<p>I gave him first aid; I apologized for not being able to do
more, and I told him that towards evening it might be possible
to carry him to Arlon, where he would receive all necessary care.</p>

<p>I returned to my aunt's house; I found her in tears; they had
just taken away her son, my cousin Jules, on the pretext that he
had fired on them. It was a piece of stupidity, for there was
nothing in the whole house but one revolver, and I was carrying
that on me. I had had it on me all the time I was at the
ambulance. I hastened to hide it under a chest, and I decided to
go and demand my cousin of the Germans. I speak their
language a little, and I was so convinced of my cousin's innocence
that I imagined a few words of explanation would make them
give him up.</p>

<p>I soon found him, tied to a tree, beside other prisoners.</p>

<p>I began to parley with a German officer.</p>

<p>He replied that there was nothing to do for the moment, that
the prisoners would be sent to Arlon, and that he was convinced
that if I followed them I should be able, at Arlon, to obtain
justice for my cousin.</p>

<p>We set out for Arlon; I was beside the prisoners. At a
determined spot we were handed over to other soldiers. I
was greatly astonished, at a given moment, to see that I had
become a prisoner myself; I was no longer accompanying my
cousin, to save him; I was sharing his fate.</p>

<p>We arrived at Arlon; we were lined up against a wall. There
were with us, notably, a woman, with two young children of nine
and ten, an old villager with his son, and other people whom I
did not know.</p>

<p>An officer on horseback approached us. He was, it seemed a
judge. He turned to the soldiers and asked, pointing to each of
us: "Did that one fire?" And the soldiers always replied in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>Now it should be noted that these soldiers had seen nothing,
and could have seen nothing, for they were not those who seized
the prisoners in the village in which they were arrested.</p>

<p>The head-dress of the troops was entirely different; the first
had helmets, and the second caps.</p>

<p>When the officer had finished pointing at us, we were informed
that we were all condemned to death.</p>

<p>An old man was seized; I myself was seized; and we were
pushed to one side, to be shot.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>
<p>The old man's son rushed towards him and tried to drag him
away from the soldiers. The result was that the son was seized,
to be shot with the father.</p>

<p>This is how things happened:</p>

<p>The two were put against a wall; a platoon of soldiers commanded
by an officer took up their position in front of them.</p>

<p>The officer commanded all their movements with a deliberation
calculated to increase the torture of the victims.</p>

<p>"Load!"... Then a pause. "Take aim!"... Then a
pause. "Fire!"...</p>

<p>The two unhappy men fell to the ground, groaning.</p>

<p>The officer went up to them, recognized that they were not
dead, and again gave orders to fire, with the same deliberation
and the same method. This time the father ceased to move; it
took a third volley to finish the son.</p>

<p>We were then all led to a guard-house.</p>

<p>There we remained for three days. We were given nothing to
eat. We fasted from the morning we were taken; it was only on
the following day, or the day after that, that we received a little
water.</p>

<p>In that room we were literally tortured.</p>

<p>We were forced to stand upright; an old man was groaning
he was so thirsty that his tongue protruded from his lips and the
flies settled on it. As he could not stand any longer, the Germans
passed a cord round his neck and attached it to a ring-bolt in the
wall, so that he was supported only on his toes. The cord
stretched and the wretched man fell now to this side, now to that.
The soldiers made him stand upright again by striking his face
with the butts of their rifles.</p>

<p>At one time his trousers fell down and we saw he was wounded
in the thigh, by bayonet-thrusts. Later he became insane. In
his delirium he cried: "Prepare food for the cows."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It was a
horrible scene.</p>

<p>At another time the woman was taken out, with her two little
children, and all three were shot against the wall of the Palais de
Justice at Arlon. The soldiers asserted that they had "found a
German soldier's purse" in this woman's house.</p>

<p>The time passed in the most atrocious moral anguish and
physical suffering. We had lost all notion of time. The soldiers
insulted us, spat upon us, made signs that our throats would be
cut, that we were going to be shot. They took a pleasure in
drinking in front of us.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>At a certain moment an officer of superior rank entered the
room. He came up to me and asked: "Why are you here?"</p>

<p>I replied: "They accuse us of having fired on the troops."
Immediately he turned his back upon me, but I cried, with
energy: "Yes, and far from having fired on them, I looked after
them. If you want the proof of this, ask the soldier called Kohn
who must be in the hospital here at Arlon."</p>

<p>I then told him of Kohn. He went to the hospital, and
returned some time later; he had found the soldier Kohn, who
confirmed my story.</p>

<p>An officer on horseback (the judge) came to the door of the
guard-room: we were sent out, my cousin and I, and without
even questioning us he said, "You are acquitted." I protested,
saying: "There are still five or six people there of my village
who are no more guilty than we are."</p>

<p>They were sent out, and the judge told them, as he told me,
without any further inquiry, "You are acquitted."</p>

<p>As for the unhappy old man, I will tell you later how he escaped.
He returned to his village; he is crippled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I remained at Arlon until the end of August, at the house of
one of my relatives, whose business brought him daily into contact
with the Belgian authorities and the German army. I was
thus able to obtain a good deal of precise information.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Germans entered Arlon on the 12th August. They came
from Mersch, in the Grand-Duchy. Several days earlier, all the
weapons the inhabitants possessed had been deposited at the
Hôtel de Ville. The people of Arlon knew from the newspapers
what atrocities the Germans had committed in the neighbourhood
of Liége, at Visé, Herve, Battice, Warsage, etc., and they were
far from meditating any disturbance.</p>

<p>On entering the town the Uhlans began to break in the doors
with the butts of their rifles.</p>

<p>On the following day Commandant von der Esch, commandant
of the town, had a notice posted up, which I have
copied <i>verbatim</i>.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Proclamation.</span></div>

<p>Luminous signals have been made to-night between Freylange
and the lower part of this town; one of our patrols has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
attacked; our telephone wires have been cut. To punish the
population guilty of these acts of ill-will, I order for to-day at
3 o'clock the burning of the village of Freylange and the sack
of 100 houses in the west of Arlon. I also condemn the town
to pay a war contribution of 100,000 frs., which must be paid
over before 6 p.m., or I shall have the hostages shot.</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Von der Esch.</span><br />
</div></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>While the communal administration of Arlon was deliberating
on the subject of the war contribution, the burning of Freylange
and the sack of 100 houses of Arlon was carried out according to
the programme.</p>

<p>After the 100,000 frs. had been paid to the Germans, they
summoned to the general headquarters, established in the Hôtel
de Ville of the northern portion of Arlon, a police agent, named
Lempreur, and instructed him to proceed to arrest those who
had fired on the German troops. He came back to say that he
had found no one. "Ah!" they told him, "you are going about
it unwillingly! Very good; you shall pay for the others." And
without listening to his pleading, without allowing him to see his
wife or children again, he was placed with his back to a door and
a firing platoon shot him down.</p>

<p>I saw the door at the Hôtel de Ville; it was riddled with
bullets.</p>

<p>A few days later another army division replaced the first.
Immediately the town was condemned to pay a fresh war contribution:
a million francs.</p>

<p>The town could get together only 238,000 frs. It was let off
the remainder.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>From the day when I was set at liberty we used almost daily
to hear of executions in Arlon; they were of prisoners, brought
just as we were, from the neighbouring villages, notably from
Rossignol and Tintigny, who were shot in small parties.</p>

<p>One of these executions took place in the courtyard of the
Church of St. Donat. The Dean succeeded in obtaining pardon
for two of the condemned.</p>

<p>The most important execution was that of 123 (others say 127)
inhabitants of Rossignol and its immediate surroundings, who
were shot on 26th August. They were taken near the viaduct
which passes over the Arlon railway-station (towards the connecting
station). They were killed in small groups of ten or
twelve. Those who were not dead were finished with the bayonet.
Each group had to climb over the surrounding corpses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
They kept to the last a lady of Rossignol, Mme. Hurieaux, who
thus had to see her husband and the greater part of the inhabitants
of her village killed before her eyes. She died crying "Vive
la Belgique! Vive la France!"</p>

<p>Here is one little detail which I was able to verify. When the
receiver and examiner of Customs of Arlon learned of the
approaching arrival of the Germans they removed all the money
from the safe, leaving only copper coin to the value of about a
franc. The Germans immediately proceeded to break open the
safe, but succeeded only after two days' work. Infuriated by this
discomfiture, they used the safe as a commode.</p></blockquote>

<p>But whatever the moral sufferings inflicted on
those who were executed, the tortures which the
Germans applied to those against whom no accusation
was brought were a hundred times more
atrocious. Think of the martyrdom of Mme. Cambier,
of Nimy, who was forced to tread on her son's
brains; and the sufferings of the innumerable men
and women of whom the Germans made a living
shield, at Anseremme, Mons, Tournai, and Charleroi
(p. <a href="#Page_195">195</a>). As to Charleroi, here is a detail not recorded
by Herr Heymel. The prisoners collected
at Jumet and Odelissert were tied in couples by the
wrists, to prevent them from trying to escape when
the French should fire on them. Moreover, they
had to walk with their hands raised. When, by
reason of fatigue, they dropped their arms, the
soldiers struck them with the butts of their rifles.
We know a man who was thus placed before the
German troops, who saw one of his relatives killed at
his side, and two of the latter's sons. He himself
received three bullets, one in the right wrist, one in
the left arm, and the third under the chin. He
escaped, but is lamed for life.</p>

<p>Imagine also the tortures suffered by the civil
prisoners who, in defiance of all justice, were sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
to Germany. Hunger, thirst, threats, and insults;
packed into cattle-trucks, they had no room to lie
down, or even to sit. Above all, they had no news
of their families. On the 4th September, 1914, more
than 100 inhabitants of Lebbeke, near Termonde, were
placed as a screen in front of the German troops
marching against Termonde. In the evening, those
who had not been shot were added to others just
captured, and all together, in all some 300, were sent
into Germany. At the moment when these unhappy
folk were leaving Lebbeke the Germans set fire
to some of the houses, and kindly informed the
prisoners that the whole village was about to be
burned. Moreover, they said, the women and children
would in part be killed, and the rest driven off
in the direction of Termonde and Gand. Imagine,
if you can, the sufferings endured by these unfortunate
people for the two months during which they
remained without news of their homes, in the conviction
that their families were massacred or wandering
wretchedly across the devastated country. While
by means of these cruel lies, whose horrible effect
was systematically calculated, they filled with despair
the hearts of those who were departing, the soldiers
amused themselves also by wringing the hearts of
the poor women&mdash;mothers, wives, sisters, daughters&mdash;who
remained in the village. For they, too, were
for long weeks without news from the prisoners, and
the abominable manner in which the German troops,
drunk with carnage, had assassinated, on the day of
exodus, twelve of their fellow-citizens (<i>9th Report</i>),
permitted them to entertain the most frightful
suppositions.</p>

<p>Make no mistake: the case of Lebbeke is far
from being exceptional. All the civil prisoners were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
treated with the same barbarity, a barbarity utterly
unjustified, since, in the judgment of Baron von
Bissing, no complaint had been formulated against
the civil prisoners who have been sent back to their
homes. But all have not returned. In June 1915, for
example, most of the prisoners from Visé were still
in Germany. As for those taken from Rossignol and
so many other localities in Luxemburg, they will
never return, alas! They have been shot without
pretext.</p>

<p>Another horrible torture consists in the suppression
of communications between the Belgian soldiers and
their parents. Since mid-October 1914 all connections
have been severed between the Belgian army
which is fighting on the Yser and the Belgians
remaining in Belgium. Those who seek to establish
communication between the Belgian soldiers and
their relatives are spied out and sentenced.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Against Jules-Arthur de Cuypere, bachelor, domiciled in the
last instance at Liége, a deprivation of liberty of five months has
been pronounced, because, contrary to the known regulations, he
took charge, during a number of journeys to the Dutch frontier and
into Holland, of a large number of letters from Belgian soldiers in
France and interned Belgian prisoners in Holland; and delivered
these letters, addressed to different members of families of Namur
and the environs, at their addresses, by carrying them thither. At
the same time he rendered himself guilty by crossing the frontier.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, 5-6th July, 1915.)<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Since the spring of 1915 the posts have been
operating between Belgium and Holland, so that
those few privileged persons who have a correspondent
in Holland might thus indirectly obtain
news if the Germans had authorized correspondence
through an intermediary. But they have strictly
forbidden it (pp. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>-<a href="#Page_23">3</a>). They could easily organize a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
service enabling soldiers to write to their relations:
"I am going on all right ... I am wounded ..."
and enabling the relations to reply, so that the
soldiers' families would be reassured; while now the
only news arrives by precarious methods, and often
goes astray. But what our enemies desire is to
make the poor relatives suffer as much as possible.
We do not believe that such a form of torture has
ever in any previous war been inflicted on a whole
population. It is untrue, it seems, that Bismarck
was the first to use the words which have been attributed
to him: "In territories occupied by our victorious
troops the inhabitants must be left nothing
but eyes to weep with." But he quoted them with
an approval that made them his own. Now they
have come true.</p>

<p>Here is quite another kind of moral torture. The
Germans are fond of leading small groups of Belgian
prisoners through the streets of Brussels at moments
when the latter are as busy as possible: for instance,
on Sunday afternoons. One can imagine the humiliation
of the poor soldiers exposed to the curiosity of
the crowd; but it delights their guardians. It was
evidently the desire to enjoy, simultaneously, the
misery of the prisoners and the impotent anger of
the spectators which led the Germans, at the time of
their entry into Louvain on the 19th August, and
into Brussels on the 20th, to place a few Belgian
countrymen, with their hands tied behind their
backs, at the head of their columns. In ancient
Rome captives used to walk before the triumphal
car of the conqueror. Do not the Germans realize
how utterly this practice is contrary to the humane
principles enjoined by Article 4 of the Hague Convention?
We must suppose that they do not; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
not only do they not abandon the practice, but they
make use of it to coin money.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Condemnation of the Town of Roulers.</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Amsterdam</span>, <i>29th May</i> (Havre Agency).&mdash;The town of Roulers
is condemned to pay a fresh fine of 1&frac12; millions, because the population
cheered Belgian prisoners passing through the town.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="fr">L'Ami de l'Ordre.</i>)<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Impossible, it will be said, to invent tortures yet
more diabolic. But no, when it is a question of
doing evil, <i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i> can surpass itself.</p>

<p>Imagine the mentality of the person who sent to
M. Brostens, of Antwerp, the identity-disc of his son,
who was taken prisoner. And imagine the inward
joy of the sender in picturing the parents' despair on
receiving the medal!</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Refined Cruelty.</span></div>

<p>When they make prisoners they sometimes detach the identification-discs
from the men and send them, unaccompanied by
comment, to the parents, to make them believe that their son
is dead.</p>

<p>This is what has just happened to M. Brostens, Lieutenant of
Customs, of Antwerp. Having received, a few days ago, his son's
regimental number, he went into mourning. So yesterday morning,
what was not his amazement to see his son return, who,
having been made prisoner at the beginning of the war, had
succeeded in escaping.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="fr">Le Matin</i>, Antwerp, 14th September, 1914.)<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Here, perhaps, the culprit was an uncultivated
soldier. But what are we to think of the mentality
of Baron von der Goltz, when he informs us by
placard that a record is kept in a register of all
aggressions against the German army, and that the
localities in which such attacks have taken place
may expect to receive their punishment?</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">General Government of Belgium.</span></div>

<p>It has recently happened, in the regions which are not at
present occupied by the German troops in more or less force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
that convoys of wagons or patrols have been attacked, by
surprise, by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>I draw the attention of the public to the fact that a register is
kept of the towns and communes in whose vicinity such attacks
have occurred, and that they may expect their punishment as
soon as the troops are passing through their neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="right">
The Governor-General in Belgium,<br />
<span class="smcap">Baron von der Goltz</span>,<br />
<i>General-Field-Marshal</i>.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>When one learns on what ultra-trivial hints the
German troops have based their condemnation of
the inhabitants, one may conclude that not a commune
will escape repression. It was evidently this
generalized terror which the Governor wished to
inspire. He, too, wished to have the pleasure of
inflicting moral torture.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To give point to the contrast between the mentality
of our oppressors and our own, between their
<i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i> and our civilization, we should like to reproduce
a letter in which a young girl, living in Gand,
invited Belgian women to enter the hospitals for the
purpose of assisting the wounded, Germans as well
as our own, to write to their families. Committees
of this kind were immediately constituted, notably
in Brussels.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Belgian Compassion.</span></div>

<p>M. Paul Fredericq, Professor at the University of Gand, writes
to the <i xml:lang="fr">Soir</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A young girl of Gand has had a touching inspiration.</p>

<p>"She wished Belgian women who can write English and
German, forgetting international hatred, and listening only to
the voice of compassion, to attend at the ambulances and hospitals,
in order to place themselves at the disposal of wounded
foreigners, without distinction, and to write, at their dictation,
letters intended to reassure their relatives.</p>

<p>"This truly Christian work of charity would put an end to the
anguish of so many mothers, who know that their sons are
engaged on the Belgian battlefields.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am certain that this appeal to the good hearts of our girls
and women will not have been made in vain."</p>

<p>While the Germans are butchering our sons and wives, this
is what Belgian hearts are thinking of.</p>

<div class="right">
(<i xml:lang="fr">Le Peuple</i>, 10th August, 1914.)<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Finally, to close with, here is a numerical example
which, better than any reasoning, gives you the
<i xml:lang="de">Kultur</i> of the German Army to the life:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the morning of Sunday, the 23rd August,
1914, the population of Fonds de Leffe (a suburb
of Dinant) comprised 251 men and boys, including
some fifteen inhabitants of neighbouring communes
whom the Germans had dragged away with them.
By the evening of the following day 243 had been
put to death: none of those taken was spared; the
eight who escaped the massacre had succeeded in
fleeing. "Happily"&mdash;we were told by a woman
whose father, husband, and four brothers-in-law
were massacred&mdash;"happily many of the men had
left for the army and were fighting on the Yser.
A strange war, in which the soldiers are less
exposed than the children, the old folks, and the
sick who are left at home!"</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
